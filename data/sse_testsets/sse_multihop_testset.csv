What is the project idea related to creating a dataset of goverment-developed OS software?,"The project idea is to create a dataset of government-developed OS software, which would help in understanding the state of such software, including whether it is buildable, has open development history, and has requirements documentation.","<1-hop>

B6. Dataset of government-developed OS software
‚Ä¢ Governments develop & use software for supporting society‚Ä®
Open-source development & policies are on the rise
‚Ä¢ But studying government software is diÔ¨Écult b/c we don‚Äôt know what is out 
there‚Ä®
‚Üí Lack of incentive to make popular ‚Ä®
‚Üí Language barriers
‚Ä¢ Create a comprehensive dataset, incl. data to understand state of software: 
buildable?, open dev. history?, requirements documentation?
‚Ä¢ Could start with NL, but including your / other countries greatly appreciated!"

How can static code analysis in data science projects help in designing more sustainablility-focused data centers?,"Static code analysis in data science projects can help in designing more sustainablility-focused data centers by identifying energy hotspots in the code. This allows developers to review and optimize code that may contribute to higher energy consumption, thereby supporting the development of more efficient and sustainable data centers.","<1-hop>

C6 - Green Shift Left
‚Ä¢ Estimate energy eÔ¨Éciency using static code analysis.
‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt need an accurate value.
‚Ä¢ It is useful to know which code is more likely to 
introduce energy hotspots and that should be 
reviewed with more attention.
‚Ä¢ Can be scoped to a particular domain (react, php, data 
science, web, etc., etc.)

How shuffling reduce risk when reduce size in software engineering?,"Shuffling reduce risk by controlling external factors like room temperature changes, which help in reducing size in software engineering.","<1-hop>

Shuffle 
üîÄ
‚Ä¢ It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that 
it is impossible to control all of them.
‚Ä¢ If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B:
‚Ä¢ External conditions that change over time will have a diÔ¨Äerent bias in 
the 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes).
‚Ä¢ If you shuÔ¨Ñe, you reduce this risk.

"What are the practical applications of neuromorphic computing, and how does its biological inspiration influence its implementation in modern computing systems?","Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the human brain, offers practical applications such as event-based vision systems and efficient processing of sensory data. Its biological inspiration influences its implementation through the use of spiking neural networks and physical artificial neurons, enabling more energy-efficient and brain-like computation methods.","<1-hop>

Neuromorphic computing
Neuromorphic computing is an approach to computing that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons to do computations.
