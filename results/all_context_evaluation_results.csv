and out of cells.\n Less frequently, the word ""chloride"" may also form part of the ""common"" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded.\n For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent C−Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.', 'Title: Heptanoic acid\nHeptanoic
