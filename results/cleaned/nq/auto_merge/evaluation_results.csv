what purpose did seasonal monsoon winds have on trade,"[""Title: Trade winds\nTrade winds - wikipedia  Trade winds  Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the weather phenomenon . For other uses , see Tradewind . The westerlies ( blue arrows ) and trade winds ( yellow and brown arrows )  The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics , within the lower portion of the Earth 's atmosphere , in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth 's equator . The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere , strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase . Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world 's oceans for centuries , and enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .   In meteorology , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America . Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge . The weaker the trade winds become , the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses .

where did the idea of fortnite come from,"[""Development   History   Fortnite was first revealed at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards ( VGA ) , with Epic 's former design director Cliff Bleszinski introducing a trailer for the game . Donald Mustard , creative lead at Epic , said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea , before we even made the game '' . The title , which started out as an internal game jam project , represents a departure from the company 's previous work . As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event , Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite , describing it as `` a world where you explore , you scavenge , you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget , he also echoed these statements , claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that , right ? But creatively for the team , Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' , and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons . ''   As the game was at its very preliminary stages at the VGA reveal , the goal of this reveal was to seek public interest in the title and potential publishing partners as to decide on the game 's release platforms and timeframe . During the July 2012 San Diego Comic Con , Epic announced that Fortnite would be an exclusive personal computer title , and the first one to be developed by Epic using their new Unreal 4 game engine , with a planned release in 2013 . The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time . They further opted for personal computer exclusivity to avoid the difficulty of having to go through console certification , and as they planned to be constantly monitoring and tweaking the game , acting as a dungeon master , the personal computer approach would allow them to do this without restrictions normally set by console manfuctures ."", ""Ars Technica .

the south west wind blows across nigeria between,"[""Its warmth and high humidity gives it a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious rainfall , which is a result of the condensation of water vapour in the rapidly rising air .   The Tropical monsoon climate has a very small temperature range . Then temperature ranges are almost constant throughout the year , for example , Warri town in the southern part of Nigeria , records a maximum of 28 ° C ( 82.4 ° F ) for its hottest month while its lowest temperature is 26 ° C ( 78.8 ° F ) in its coldest month . The temperature difference of Warri town is not more than 2 ° C ( 5 ° F ) .   The southern part of Nigeria experiences heavy and abundant rainfall . These storms are usually convectional in nature due to the regions proximity , to the equatorial belt . The annual rainfall received in this region is very high , usually above the 2,000 mm ( 78.7 in ) rainfall totals giving for tropical rainforest climates worldwide . Over 4,000 mm ( 157.5 in ) of rainfall is received in the coastal region of Nigeria around the Niger delta area . Bonny town found in the coastal region of the Niger delta area in southern Nigeria receives well over 4,000 mm ( 157.5 in ) of rainfall annually . The rest of the southeast receives between 2,000 and 3,000 mm ( 118.1 in ) of rain per year .   The southern region of Nigeria experiences a double rainfall maxima characterised by two high rainfall peaks , with a short dry season and a longer dry season falling between and after each peaks . The first rainy season begins around March and last to the end of July with a peak in June , this rainy season is followed by a short dry break in August known as the August break which is a short dry season lasting for two to three weeks in August . This break is broken by the short rainy season starting around early September and lasting to Mid October with a peak period at the end of September . The ending of the short rainy season in October is followed by long dry season . This period starts from late October and lasts till early March with peak dry conditions between early December and late February .   The tropical savanna climate or tropical wet and dry climate , is extensive in area and covers most of Western Nigeria to central Nigeria beginning from the Tropical rainforest climate boundary in southern Nigeria to the central part of Nigeria , where it exerts enormous influence on the region .   This climate , the tropical savanna climate exhibits a well marked rainy season and a dry season with a single peak known as the summer maximum due to its distance from the equator . Temperatures are above 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) throughout the year . Abuja , Nigeria 's capital city found in central Nigeria , has a temperature range of 18.45 ° C ( 65.21 ° F ) to 36.9 ° C ( 98.4 ° F ) , and an annual rainfall of about 1,500 mm ( 59.1 in ) with a single rainfall maxima in September .   The single Dry season experienced in this climate , the tropical savanna climate in central Nigeria beginning from December to march , is hot and dry with the Harmattan wind , a continental tropical ( CT ) airmass laden with dust from the Sahara Desert prevailing throughout this period .   With the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) swinging northward over West Africa from the Southern Hemisphere in April , heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of squall lines also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical ( south westerlies ) and the Continental tropical ( north easterlies ) , begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity , heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria. Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from 1,100 mm ( 43.3 in ) in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over 2,000 mm ( 78.7 in ) along the south western escarpment of the Jos Plateau .   The Sahel climate or tropical dry climate , is the predominant climate type in the northern part of Nigeria . Annual rainfall totals are lower compared to the southern and central part of Nigeria . The rainy season in the northern part of Nigeria last for only three to four months ( June -- September ) . The rest of the year is hot and dry with temperatures climbing as high as 40 ° C ( 104.0 ° F ) .   Alpine climate or highland climate or mountain climate are found on highlands regions in Nigeria . Highlands with the alpine climate in Nigeria , are well over 1,520 metres ( 4,987 ft ) above sea level . Due to their location in the tropics , this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands , mountains and the plateau regions standing above this height , a cool mountain climate .   Seasons ( edit )   Nigeria , like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands , has only two seasons . These are the dry season and the rainy season . The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert , locally known as Harmattan , or by its main name , The Tropical Continental ( CT ) airmass , while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean , locally known as the south west wind , or by its main name , The Tropical Maritime ( MT ) airmass . These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the trade winds .   Trade winds ( edit )   Tropical Maritime airmass ( edit )   The tropical maritime airmass ( MT ) is responsible for Nigeria 's rainy season . This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June . Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat , of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) known as the harmattan . The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) , is caused by the sun 's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere . This shift begins from February and ends in June , when the sun is fully overhead , at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis , the sun crosses the equator ( around March ) , moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere . West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time . The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa . Temperatures can climb as high as 35 ° C ( 95.0 ° F ) over west Africa during this time . Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as 48 ° C ( 118.4 ° F ) in cities like Maiduguri .   The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria ( between March to May ) . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of West Africa , is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land . This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) in turn , causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time ( around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria ) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass ( Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) ) , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) finally retreats from most part of Nigeria , and the West African atmosphere around April to May , leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria . The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun . The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth ."", 'Contents  ( hide )   1 Climate types found in Nigeria   2 Seasons   3 Trade winds   3.1 Tropical maritime airmass   3.2 Tropical continental airmass   3.2.', ""The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun .

who was the governor general of india when country became independent,"[""For individual Governor - Generals , see List of governors - general of India .

The office was created in 1773 , with the title of Governor - General of the Presidency of Fort William . The officer had direct control only over Fort William , but supervised other British East India Company officials in India . Complete authority over all of British India was granted in 1833 , and the official came to be known as the `` Governor - General of India '' .   In 1858 , the territories of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British government ; see British Raj . The governor - general ( now also the viceroy ) headed the central government of India , which administered the provinces of British India , including the Punjab , Bengal , Bombay , Madras , the United Provinces , and others . However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally sovereign princely states or `` native states '' , whose relationship was not with the British government , but directly with the monarch . To reflect the governor - general 's role as the representative of the monarch to the feudal rulers of the princely states , from 1858 the term Viceroy and Governor - General of India ( known in short as the Viceroy of India ) was applied to him ."", 'The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor - general continued to exist in each country separately -- until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively .   Until 1858 , the governor - general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British government ; the Secretary of State for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of his powers . After 1947 , the sovereign continued to appoint the governor - general , but did so on the advice of the Indian government .   Governors - General served at the pleasure of the sovereign , though the practice was to have them serve five - year terms . Governors - General could have their commission rescinded ; and if one was removed , or left , a provisional governor - general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen . The first Governor - General of British India was Warren Hastings , and the first Governor - General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten .

Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were governed by the East India Company , which nominally acted as the agent of the Mughal Emperor .', ""In 1773 , motivated by corruption in the Company , the British government assumed partial control over the governance of India with the passage of the Regulating Act of 1773 . A Governor - General and Supreme Council of Bengal were appointed to rule over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal . The first Governor - General and Council were named in the Act .   The Charter Act 1833 replaced the Governor - General and Council of Fort William with the Governor - General and Council of India . The power to elect the Governor - General was retained by the Court of Directors , but the choice became subject to the Sovereign 's approval .   After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the East India Company 's territories in India were put under the direct control of the Sovereign . The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the Governor - General in the Sovereign . The Governor - General , in turn , had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India , subject to the Sovereign 's approval .   India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947 , but Governors - General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written . Louis Mountbatten , 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma remained Governor - General of India for some time after independence , but the two nations were otherwise headed by native Governors - General . India became a secular republic in 1950 ; Pakistan became an Islamic one in 1956 .   Functions ( edit )  Lord Curzon in his robes as Viceroy of India , a post he held from 1899 to 1905 . Lord Mountbatten addressing the Chamber of Princes as Crown Representative in the 1940s  The Governor - General originally had power only over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal . The Regulating Act , however , granted them additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence . The other Presidencies of the East India Company ( Madras , Bombay and Bencoolen ) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the Governor - General and Council of Fort William .   The powers of the Governor - General , in respect of foreign affairs , were increased by the India Act 1784 . The Act provided that the other Governors under the East India Company could not declare war , make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the Governor - General or by the Company 's Court of Directors .   While the Governor - General thus became the controller of foreign policy in India , he was not the explicit head of British India . That status came only with the Charter Act 1833 , which granted him `` superintendence , direction and control of the whole civil and military Government '' of all of British India . The Act also granted legislative powers to the Governor - General and Council .   After 1858 , the Governor - General ( now usually known as the Viceroy ) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the Sovereign 's representative . India was divided into numerous provinces , each under the head of a Governor , Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator . Governors were appointed by the British Government , to whom they were directly responsible ; Lieutenant Governors , Chief Commissioners , and Administrators , however , were appointed by and were subordinate to the Viceroy . The Viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers : the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Maharaja of Mysore , the Maharaja ( Scindia ) of Gwalior , the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad ( Gaekwar ) Maharaja of Baroda . The remaining princely rulers were overseen either by the Rajputana Agency and Central India Agency , which were headed by representatives of the Viceroy , or by provincial authorities .   The Chamber of Princes was an institution established in 1920 by a Royal Proclamation of King - Emperor George V to provide a forum in which the princely rulers could voice their needs and aspirations to the government . The chamber usually met only once a year , with the Viceroy presiding , but it appointed a Standing Committee , which met more often .   Upon independence in August 1947 , the title of Viceroy was abolished . The representative of the British Sovereign became known once again as the Governor - General . C. Rajagopalachari became the only Indian Governor - General . However , once India acquired independence , the Governor - General 's role became almost entirely ceremonial , with power being exercised on a day - to - day basis by the Indian cabinet . After the nation became a republic in 1950 , the President of India continued to perform the same functions .   Council ( edit )  Main articles : Council of India and Viceroy 's Executive Council The Viceregal Lodge in Simla , built in 1888 , was the summer residence of the Viceroy of India Viceregal Lodge , Delhi , where Viceroy Lord Hardinge stayed ( 1912 -- 31 ) , now the main building of the University of Delhi  The Governor - General was always advised by a Council on the exercise of his legislative and executive powers . The Governor - General , while exercising many functions , was referred to as the `` Governor - General in Council . ''   The Regulating Act 1773 provided for the election of four counsellors by the East India Company 's Court of Directors . The Governor - General had a vote along with the counsellors , but he also had an additional vote to break ties . The decision of the Council was binding on the Governor - General .   In 1784 , the Council was reduced to three members ; the Governor - General continued to have both an ordinary vote and a casting vote . In 1786 , the power of the Governor - General was increased even further , as Council decisions ceased to be binding .   The Charter Act 1833 made further changes to the structure of the Council . The Act was the first law to distinguish between the executive and legislative responsibilities of the Governor - General . As provided under the Act , there were to be four members of the Council elected by the Court of Directors . The first three members were permitted to participate on all occasions , but the fourth member was only allowed to sit and vote when legislation was being debated .   In 1858 , the Court of Directors ceased to have the power to elect members of the Council . Instead , the one member who had a vote only on legislative questions came to be appointed by the Sovereign , and the other three members by the Secretary of State for India .   The Indian Councils Act 1861 made several changes to the Council 's composition . Three members were to be appointed by the Secretary of State for India , and two by the Sovereign . ( The power to appoint all five members passed to the Crown in 1869 ) . The Viceroy was empowered to appoint an additional six to twelve members ( changed to ten to sixteen in 1892 , and to sixty in 1909 ) . The five individuals appointed by the Sovereign or the Indian Secretary headed the executive departments , while those appointed by the Viceroy debated and voted on legislation .   In 1919 , an Indian legislature , consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly , took over the legislative functions of the Viceroy 's Council . The Viceroy nonetheless retained significant power over legislation . He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature 's consent for `` ecclesiastical , political ( and ) defense '' purposes , and for any purpose during `` emergencies . '' He was permitted to veto , or even stop debate on , any bill . If he recommended the passage of a bill , but only one chamber cooperated , he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber . The Legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence . The President of the Council of State was appointed by the Viceroy ; the Legislative Assembly elected its President , but the election required the Viceroy 's approval .   Style and title ( edit )   Until 1833 , the title of the position was `` Governor - General of Bengal '' . The Government of India Act 1833 converted the title into `` Governor - General of India . '' The title `` Viceroy and Governor - General '' was first used in the queen 's proclamation appointing Viscount Canning in 1858 . It was never conferred by an act of parliament , but was used in warrants of precedence and in the statutes of knightly orders . In usage , `` viceroy '' is employed where the governor - general 's position as the monarch 's representative is in view . The viceregal title was not used when the sovereign was present in India . It was meant to indicate new responsibilities , especially ritualistic ones , but it conferred no new statutory authority . The governor - general regularly used the title in communications with the Imperial Legislative Council , but all legislation was made only in the name of the Governor - General - in - Council ( or the Government of India ) .   The Governor - General was styled Excellency and enjoyed precedence over all other government officials in India . He was referred to as ' His Excellency ' and addressed as ' Your Excellency ' . From 1858 to 1947 , the Governor - General was known as the Viceroy of India ( from the French roi , meaning ' king ' ) , and wives of Viceroys were known as Vicereines ( from the French reine , meaning ' queen ' ) . The Vicereine was referred to as ' Her Excellency ' and was also addressed as ' Your Excellency ' .""]","['India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but Governors-General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written.

Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details . ( January 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction ( AHTR ) is a type of transfusion reaction that is associated with hemolysis . It occurs very soon after the transfusion , and within 24 hrs post-transfusion . It can occur quickly upon transfusing a few milliliters , or up to 1 -- 2 hours post-transfusion .   It is also known as an `` immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction '' . This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies ( IgG , IgM ) . It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood . Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood , facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade . The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) may also occur . The most common cause is clerical error ( i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient ) .

In the UK in 2014 there were 18 episodes of hemolysis due to other causes ( 1 in 147,972 blood components transfused ) .   Types ( edit )   Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are divided into two types .   Intravascular haemolysis ( edit )   The most common cause of this reaction is ABO blood groups incompatibility , secondary to human errors . In this process , the donor 's red blood cells are destroyed by recipient 's preformed antibodies through the activation of complement system . Thus , the donor 's red blood cells break open and releases haemoglobin into the blood . The haemoglobin is then excreted into urine , causes haemoglobinuria . Meanwhile , haemoglobin can also pass through the liver system and process into bilirubin , which accumulates under the skin , causing jaundice . The release of red blood cell debris and the activation of complement system causes uncontrolled clotting ( disseminated intravascular coagulation ) and circulatory shock .   Extravascular haemolysis ( edit )   In this case , the donor 's red blood cells are recognised and bound to IgG antibodies . Macrophages then recognise these IgG antibodies and engulf these red blood cells , removing the red blood cells from the blood circulation into liver and spleen . These red blood cells are then destroyed by macrophages in these organs . Anti-Rh antibodies most commonly directed this type of reaction . This process is much more controlled when compared with intravascular haemolysis . Liver has adequate capacity in processing the bilirubin . Therefore , jaundice rarely occurs .   Signs and symptoms ( edit )   Early signs are fever , low blood pressure , anxiety , and red - colored urine .   Late signs are generalized bleeding , caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation , and low blood pressure .   Laboratory assessment is based on a positive Direct Antiglobulin Test ( DAT ) , a decrease in serum haptoglobin , and an increase in blood levels of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase and indirect bilirubin levels .   Pathophysiology ( edit )   Immune mediated ( edit )   This may be caused by preformed IgM anti-A , anti-B or both . It may also be caused by other non-ABO IgG antibodies such as Rh , Kell , or Duffy . The former results in a severe intravascular hemolysis and the latter typically causes extravascular hemolysis . The reactions are mediated by cytokines like TNF , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein , IL - 1 etc .   Non-immune mediated ( edit )   These occur when RBCs are damaged before transfusion , resulting in hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria . Clinical symptoms are nil or milder .   Diagnosis ( edit )   Differential diagnoses ( edit )    Disseminated intravascular coagulation   Hemolytic anemia   Pulmonary edema   Septic shock    Management ( edit )    In case of antibody - mediated acute hemolytic transfusion reactions ,   Immediately discontinue the transfusion while maintaining venous access for emergency management .   Anticipate low blood pressure , kidney failure , and DIC .   Prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of renal failure may include low - dose dopamine , vigorous hydration with intravenous crystalloid solutions ( e.g. , lactated Ringer 's solution or normal saline ) , and osmotic diuresis with mannitol .   If DIC is documented and bleeding requires treatment , transfusions of frozen plasma , pooled cryoprecipitates for fibrinogen , and / or platelet concentrates may be indicated .     In case of non-antibody mediated AHR   This does not require rigorous management .   Diuresis induced by an infusion of normal saline until the intense red color of hemoglobinuria ceases is usually adequate treatment .      Prognosis ( edit )   The major complication is that the hemoglobin , released by the destruction of red blood cells , may cause acute kidney failure ( also known as the `` oliguric phase '' ) . About 20 deaths occur annually in the US due to AHTR .

It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood. Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood, facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade. The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may also occur. The most common cause is clerical error (i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient).']","In an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, the red blood cells (RBCs) from the donor are rapidly destroyed by the recipient's antibodies. This can occur through two main processes:

1. **Intravascular Hemolysis**: The donor's RBCs are destroyed within the blood vessels due to ABO blood group incompatibility. The recipient's preformed antibodies activate the complement system, leading to the destruction of the donor's RBCs, releasing hemoglobin into the blood, which can cause hemoglobinuria and jaundice.

2. **Extravascular Hemolysis**: The donor's RBCs are recognized and bound by IgG antibodies, and then engulfed and destroyed by macrophages in the liver and spleen. This process is more controlled, and jaundice is less common.

In both cases, the destruction of RBCs can lead to complications such as jaundice, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and circulatory shock.",rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies,0.9999999999666668,1.0,1.0,0.22,0.0,0.8498045104177446

A cadre of 271 enlisted men was trained in aircraft ground support trades at Chanute , beginning in July 1941 ; the skills being taught were so technical that setting up segregated classes was deemed impossible . This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee and Maxwell Fields in Alabama .', 'Tuskegee Airmen ( unofficial )       Emblems of wing     Active   1940 -- 1948     Country   United States     Branch   United States Army Air Corps United States Army Air Forces United States Air Force     Role   trained for aerial combat     Part of   graduates assigned to the 332nd Fighter Group ( 99th Fighter Squadron , 100th Fighter Squadron , 301st Fighter Squadron , 302d Fighter Squadron ) , 477th Medium Bombardment Group ( 616th Bombardment Squadron , 617th Bombardment Squadron , 618th Bombardment Squadron , 619th Bombardment Squadron )     Nickname ( s )   Red Tails Red - Tail Angels     Motto ( s )   Spit Fire     Engagements   World War II     The Tuskegee Airmen / tʌsˈkiːɡiː / is the popular name of a group of African - American military pilots ( fighter and bomber ) who fought in World War II . They formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces . The name also applies to the navigators , bombardiers , mechanics , instructors , crew chiefs , nurses , cooks and other support personnel .   All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Moton Field , the Tuskegee Army Air Field , and were educated at Tuskegee University , located near Tuskegee , Alabama . The group included five Haitians from the Haitian Air Force , and one pilot from Trinidad. . It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic .   Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B - 25 Mitchell bombers , they never served in combat . The 99th Pursuit Squadron ( later , 99th Fighter Squadron ) was the first black flying squadron , and the first to deploy overseas ( to North Africa in April 1943 , and later to Sicily and Italy ) . The 332nd Fighter Group , which originally included the 100th , 301st , and 302nd Fighter Squadrons , was the first black flying group . It deployed to Italy in early 1944 .', ""The Tuskegee program officially began June 1941 with the 99th Pursuit Squadron at Tuskegee University . The unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men , and was backed by an entire service arm . After primary training at Moton Field , they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the west for conversion training onto operational types . Consequently , Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training ( basic , advanced , and transition ) at a single location . Initial planning called for 500 personnel in residence at a time .   By mid-1942 , over six times that many were stationed at Tuskegee , even though only two squadrons were training there .

African - American contractor McKissack and McKissack , Inc. was in charge of the contract . The company 's 2,000 workmen , the Alabama Works Progress Administration , and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months . The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057 . The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis , Jr. , one of only two black line officers then serving .   During training , Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison . Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee . However , he was transferred on 12 January 1942 , reputedly because of his insistence that his African - American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local Caucasian civilians .   His successor , Colonel Frederick von Kimble , then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield . Contrary to new Army regulations , Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama , a policy that was resented by the airmen . Later that year , the Air Corps replaced Kimble . His replacement had been the director of instruction at Tuskegee Army Airfield , Major Noel F.

According to the 2001 census the parish had a population of 2,812 , reducing to 2,737 at the 2011 Census . Before 1996 it had been part of the Ryedale district .

There was housing for both workers and managers , in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees . It was founded by the York philanthropist , Joseph Rowntree , who was quoted as saying , `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin , after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .   The village had contemporaries such as Bournville , Saltaire , Port Sunlight and others . This was in sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century , the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree 's report of 1901 , entitled Poverty : a study of town life . It revealed appalling statistics of dark , overcrowded and insanitary housing .   As a result of the report , Joseph Rowntree 's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick , two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York . The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new ' garden ' village and the detailed designs for its first houses . They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City .   The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low , but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested . Houses were open to any working people , not just Rowntree employees . The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick . From 1950 the brickyard , which closed down in the 1930s , was developed into a nature reserve .   Due to their religious beliefs , The Rowntree family decreed there would not be a public house in the village . There never has been , although the Sports Club obtained a drink 's license in the 1980s .   Governance ( edit )   New Earswick is part of the Huntington & New Earswick Ward of the City of York Council . As of 2010 it is represented by Keith Hyman , Keith Orrel and Carol Runciman who are all members of the local Liberal Democrat Party .   A Parish Council was created in 1934 consisting of ten elected councillors and a clerk .   Community ( edit )   There is a local community centre , the Folk Hall , which hosts activities such as keep - fit , yoga , snooker , and a junior youth club . New Earswick has recreational facilities , including a swimming pool ( due for closure without public consultation ) , tennis courts and football , rugby and cricket pitches at the New Earswick Sports and Social Club . There were two open access play areas close to the Folk Hall , including a hard surface play area which have recently been bulldozed for a development of houses . There is a library based in the Integrated Children 's Centre at the local primary school , a doctor 's surgery and a range of shops , including two general stores , a pet shop and Post Office . As of 2017 the Post Office is situated within the Folk Hall .   The village has 36 allotments in two areas , Willow Bank and Sleeper Path .   In the 1960s , the Folk Hall was a live music venue featuring the likes of Procol Harum and Pink Floyd .   Geography ( edit )   The River Foss runs along the eastern boundary of New Earswick with the York to Scarborough Line running to the west . The Nestle factory and grounds mark the southern border with the northern border being the A1237 York Outer Ring Road . The village was built using bricks from the brickworks on the outskirts of the village . From 1950 the brickyard was developed into a nature reserve . The reserve is the home of New Earswick Angling Club , which was formed in 1948 ."", ""A Bit On The Side . Menoshire . p. 1 . ISBN 0947981667 .

what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"[""He suggested a stepwise evolution from `` an optic nerve merely coated with pigment , and without any other mechanism '' to `` a moderately high stage of perfection '' , and gave examples of existing intermediate steps . Darwin 's suggestions were soon shown to be correct , and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution .   Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors ."", ""The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light , found even in unicellular organisms , called `` eyespots '' . Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness : they can distinguish light from dark , sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms . They are insufficient for vision , as they can not distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from . Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups , and are common among unicellular organisms , including euglena ."", ""Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates . Another researcher , G.C. Young , has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions , based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through . All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin 's theory .   Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' . One of the many hypotheses for `` causes '' of the Cambrian explosion is the `` Light Switch '' theory of Andrew Parker : It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution . Before the Cambrian explosion , animals may have sensed light , but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision .   The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate , because the fossil record , particularly of the lower Cambrian , is poor . How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation , relative advantage to the organism , and natural selection . However , the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year , which is common in small animals . Even with these pessimistic values , the vertebrate eye would still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years .   One origin or many ? ( edit )   Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye . All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development . This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light - sensitive machinery -- even if it was not a dedicated optical organ . However , even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells . Probably , photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion . Higher - level similarities -- such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses -- reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye .   A shared trait common to all light - sensitive organs are opsins .""]","['The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots"". Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena. The euglena\'s eyespot, called a stigma, is located at its anterior end.

In 2007 , Adobe 's first version release was Adobe Flash CS3 Professional , the ninth major version of Flash . It introduced the ActionScript 3.0 programming language , which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with Flash . Adobe Flex Builder ( built on Eclipse ) targeted the enterprise application development market , and was also released the same year . Flex Builder included the Flex SDK , a set of components that included charting , advanced UI , and data services ( Flex Data Services ) .   In 2008 , Adobe released the tenth version of Flash , Adobe Flash CS4 . Flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the Flash editor , adding a motion editor panel ( similar to Adobe After Effects ) , inverse kinematics ( bones ) , basic 3D object animation , object - based animation , and other text and graphics features .

where do the greasers live in the outsiders,"[""Hinton was 18 when the book was published . The book details the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status : the working - class `` greasers '' and the upper - class `` Socs '' ( pronounced / ˈsoʊʃɪz / -- short for Socials ) . The story is told in first - person perspective by teenaged protagonist Ponyboy Curtis .   The story in the book takes place in Tulsa , Oklahoma , in 1965 , but this is never explicitly stated in the book .   A film adaptation was produced in 1983 , and a little - known short - lived television series appeared in 1990 , picking up where the movie left off . A stage adaptation was written by Christopher Sergel and published in 1990 .

Several greasers , including Ponyboy 's two older brothers -- the paternal Darry and the popular Sodapop -- come to his rescue . The next night , Ponyboy and two greaser friends , the hardened Dally and the quiet Johnny , meet Cherry and Marcia , a pair of Soc girls , at a drive - in movie theater . Cherry spurns Dally 's rude advances , but Ponyboy ends up speaking civilly with Cherry , emotionally connecting with a Soc for the first time in his life .   Afterward , Ponyboy , Johnny , and their wisecracking friend Two - Bit begin to walk Cherry and Marcia home , when they are stopped by Cherry 's boyfriend Bob , who badly beat up Johnny a few months back . Bob and the greasers exchange taunts , but Cherry prevents a fight by willingly leaving with Bob . Ponyboy gets home at two in the morning , enraging Darry until he suddenly slaps Ponyboy . Ponyboy runs out the door and meets up with Johnny , expressing his anger at Darry 's increasing coldness in the wake of his parents ' recent deaths in a car crash .   Ponyboy and Johnny wander into a park , where Bob and four other Socs surround them . After some heated talk , Ponyboy spits at the Socs , prompting them to try to drown him in a nearby fountain , but Johnny stabs Bob , killing him and dispersing the Socs . Terrified of what to do next , Ponyboy and Johnny rush to find Dally , who gives them money and a loaded gun , directing them to hide in an abandoned church in Windrixville . During their stay there , Pony cuts and dyes his hair as a disguise , reads Gone with the Wind to Johnny , and , upon viewing a beautiful sunrise , recites the poem `` Nothing Gold Can Stay '' by Robert Frost .   Days later , Dally comes to check on them , revealing that violence between the greasers and Socs has escalated since Bob 's death into all - out city - wide warfare , with Cherry acting out of guilt as a spy for the greasers . Johnny decides to turn himself in and Dally agrees to take the boys back home . As they attempt to leave , they notice the church has caught fire and several local schoolchildren have become trapped inside . The greasers run inside the burning church to save the children , but Ponyboy is rendered unconscious by the fumes . At the hospital he discovers that he and Dally are not badly injured , but a piece of the church roof fell on Johnny and broke his back . Sodapop and Darry come to the hospital ; Darry breaks down and cries . Ponyboy then realizes that Darry cares about him , and is only hard on Ponyboy because he loves him and cares about his future .   The following morning the newspapers declare Pony and Johnny heroes , but Johnny will be charged with manslaughter for Bob 's death . Two - Bit tells them that the greaser -- Soc rivalry is to be settled in a final rumble . Ponyboy and Two - Bit are approached by a Soc named Randy , Bob 's best friend , who expresses remorse for his involvement in the gang war , lacks confidence about the rumble ending the feud , and says he will not participate .   Later , Ponyboy visits Johnny at the hospital , where he is in critical condition . On their way home , Pony spots Cherry and they talk . Cherry says she is unwilling to visit Johnny in the hospital because he killed her boyfriend . Pony calls her a traitor , but after explaining herself , they end on good terms . After escaping the hospital , Dally shows up just in time for the rumble . The greasers win the brutal fight . Afterward , Pony and Dally hurry back to the hospital to see Johnny , but he dies moments later and a maniacal Dally runs out of the room . Pony returns home that night feeling confused and disoriented . Dally calls the house to say that he has robbed a store and is running from the police . The greasers find Dally deliberately pointing an unloaded gun at the police , causing them to shoot and kill him . Overwhelmed , Ponyboy faints and is sick in bed for several days due to the resulting concussion . When the hearing finally comes , the judge frees Ponyboy from responsibility for Bob 's death and allows Pony to remain at home with Darry and Soda .   Ponyboy returns to school , but his grades drop . Although he is failing English , his teacher , Mr. Syme , says he will pass him if he writes a decent theme . In the copy of Gone with the Wind that Johnny gave him before dying , Ponyboy finds a note from Johnny describing how he will die proudly after saving the kids from the fire . Johnny also urges Ponyboy to `` stay gold '' . Ponyboy decides to write his English assignment about the recent events , and begins his essay with the opening line of the novel : `` When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house , I had only two things on my mind : Paul Newman and a ride home ...

Controversy   The Outsiders was a controversial book at the time of its publication ; it is still currently challenged and debated . It was ranked # 38 on the American Library Association 's Top 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990 -- 1999 . This book has been banned from some schools and libraries because of the portrayal of gang violence , underage smoking and drinking , strong language / slang , and family dysfunction .

where do they grow hops in the us,"[""Hops are also used in brewing for their antibacterial effect over less desirable microorganisms and for purported benefits including balancing the sweetness of the malt with bitterness and a variety of flavours and aromas . Historically , traditional herb combinations for beers were believed to have been abandoned when beers made with hops were noticed to be less prone to spoilage .

However , in a will of Pepin the Short , the father of Charlemagne , hop gardens were left to the Cloister of Saint - Denis in 768 . Not until the 13th century did hops begin to start threatening the use of gruit for flavouring . Gruit was used when taxes were levied by the nobility on hops . Whichever was taxed made the brewer then quickly switch to the other . In Britain , hopped beer was first imported from Holland around 1400 , yet hops were condemned as late as 1519 as a `` wicked and pernicious weed '' . In 1471 , Norwich , England , banned use of the plant in the brewing of ale ( `` beer '' was the name for fermented malt liquors bittered with hops ; only in recent times are the words often used as synonyms ) .   In Germany , using hops was also a religious and political choice in the early 16th century . There was no tax on hops to be paid on the Catholic church , unlike on gruit , for which the Protestant preferred hopped beer .   Hops used in England were imported from France , Holland and Germany with import duty paid for those ; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England ( Kent ) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers . Therefore , in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words ( see oast house ) . Hops were then grown as far north as Aberdeen , near breweries for infrastructure convenience .   According to Thomas Tusser 's 1557 Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry :   `` The hop for his profit I thus do exalt , It strengtheneth drink and it flavoureth malt ; And being well - brewed long kept it will last , And drawing abide , if ye draw not too fast . ''   In England there were many complaints over the quality of imported hops , the sacks of which were often contaminated by stalks , sand or straw to increase their weight . As a result , in 1603 , King James I approved an Act of Parliament banning the practice by which `` the Subjects of this Realm have been of late years abused &c. to the Value of £ 20,000 yearly , besides the Danger of their Healths '' .   Hop cultivation was begun in the present - day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers . Before prohibition , cultivation was mainly centred around New York , California , Oregon , and Washington state . Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York 's production by the 1920s , and California only produces hops on a small scale .   Hop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles .   World production ( edit )   Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates , with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north . Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however , not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada , for example , lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically , hops were not grown in Ireland , but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone .   Important production centres today are the Hallertau in Germany ( more hop - growing area than any other country as of 2006 ) , the Yakima ( Washington ) and Willamette ( Oregon ) valleys , and western Canyon County , Idaho ( including the communities of Parma , Wilder , Greenleaf , and Notus ) . The principal production centres in the UK are in Kent ( which produces Kent Goldings hops ) , Herefordshire , and Worcestershire . Essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making .  Early season hop growth in a hop yard in the Yakima River Valley of Washington with Mount Adams in the distance    Hop producing country   2012 hop output in tonnes ( t )     Germany   34,434     United States   27,782     China   11,000     Czech Republic   4,338     Poland   2,206     North Korea   2,000     Albania   1,650     United Kingdom   1,650     Slovenia   1,338     Cultivation and harvest ( edit )  A superstructure of overhead wires supports strings that in turn support bines  Although hops are grown in most of the continental United States and Canada , cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment . As hops are a climbing plant , they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile . In this way , energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth .   The hop plant 's reproduction method is that male and female flowers develop on separate plants , although occasionally a fertile individual will develop which contains both male and female flowers . Because pollinated seeds are undesirable for brewing beer , only female plants are grown in hop fields , thus preventing pollination . Female plants are propagated vegetatively , and male plants are culled if plants are grown from seeds .   Hop plants are planted in rows about 2 to 2.5 metres ( 7 to 8 ft ) apart . Each spring , the roots send forth new bines that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis . The cones grow high on the bine , and in the past , these cones were picked by hand . Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention of the mechanical hops separator , patented by Emil Clemens Horst in 1909 .   Harvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or oast house for drying . Hop houses are two - story buildings , of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap . Here the flowers are poured out and raked even . A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops . When dry , the hops are moved to a press , a sturdy box with a plunger . Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at right angles , the hops are poured in and compressed into bales .   Hop cones contain different oils , such as lupulin , a yellowish , waxy substance , an oleoresin , that imparts flavour and aroma to beer . Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone , which possess antibiotic properties , suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer 's yeast to grow . After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded .   Migrant labor and social impact ( edit )  Hops harvest in the Kingdom of Bohemia ( 1898 ) Hops harvest in Skåne , Sweden in 1937  The need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop - growing had a big social impact . Around the world , the labor - intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest . Whole families would partake and live in hoppers ' huts , with even the smallest children helping in the fields . The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham 's Of Human Bondage and a large part of George Orwell 's A Clergyman 's Daughter contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest . In England , many of those picking hops in Kent were from eastern areas of London . This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside . People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the Malvern area of Worcestershire . Some photographs have been preserved .   Particularly in Kent , because of a shortage of small - denomination coin of the realm , many growers issued their own currency to those doing the labor . In some cases , the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images , making them quite beautiful .   In the US , Prohibition had a major impact on hops productions , but remnants of this significant industry in West and Northwest US are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive throughout Sonoma County , among others . Florian Dauenhauer , of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County , became a manufacturer of hop - harvesting machines in 1940 , in part because of the hop industry 's importance to the county ."", ""Hop Growers of America .

in which regions are most of africa petroleum and natural gas found,"['Texaco operates the Pennington Terminal .   Offshore ( edit )   Oil companies in Africa investigate offshore production as an alternative area of production . Deepwater production mainly involves underwater drilling that exists 400 metres ( 1,300 ft ) or more below the surface of the water . By expanding to deep water drilling the possible sources for finding new oil reserves is expanded . Through the introduction of deep water drilling 50 % more oil is extracted than before the new forms of retrieving the oil .   Angola and Nigeria are the largest oil producers in Africa .', ""Nigeria 's proven oil reserves are estimated by the United States Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) at between 16 and 22 billion barrels ( 2.5 × 10 and 3.5 × 10 m ) , but other sources claim there could be as much as 35.3 billion barrels ( 5.61 × 10 m ) . Its reserves make Nigeria the tenth most petroleum - rich nation , and by the far the most affluent in Africa . In mid-2001 its crude oil production was averaging around 2,200,000 barrels ( 350,000 m ) per day . It is expected that the industry will continue to be profitable based on an average bench mark oil price of $85 - $90 per barrel .   Nearly all of the country 's primary reserves are concentrated in and around the delta of the Niger River , but off - shore rigs are also prominent in the well - endowed coastal region . Nigeria is one of the few major oil - producing nations still capable of increasing its oil output . Unlike most of the other OPEC countries , Nigeria is not projected to exceed peak production until at least 2009 . The reason for Nigeria 's relative unproductivity is primarily OPEC regulations on production to regulate prices on the international market . More recently , production has been disrupted intermittently by the protests of the Niger Delta 's inhabitants , who feel they are being exploited .   Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources . The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or `` South - south '' region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields . Most of Nigeria 's oil fields are small and scattered , and as of 1990 , these small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1 % of all Nigerian production . This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9 % of Nigeria 's petroleum at that time .   As a result of the numerous small fields , an extensive and well - developed pipeline network has been engineered to transport the crude oil . Also because of the lack of highly productive fields , money from the jointly operated ( with the federal government ) companies is constantly directed towards petroleum exploration and production .   Nigeria 's petroleum is classified mostly as `` light '' and `` sweet '' , as the oil is largely free of sulphur ."", ""The Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries both operate at only 30 % capacity .   It is estimated that demand and consumption of petroleum in Nigeria grows at a rate of 12.8 % annually . However , petroleum products are unavailable to most Nigerians and are quite costly , because almost all of the oil extracted by the multinational oil companies is refined overseas , while only a limited quantity is supplied to Nigerians themselves .

what type of car is a jeep considered,"[""Prior to 1940 the term `` jeep '' had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles , but the World War II `` jeep '' that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4 , arguably making them the oldest four - wheel drive mass - production vehicles now known as SUVs . The Jeep became the primary light 4 - wheel - drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II , as well as the postwar period . The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war . Doug Stewart noted : `` The spartan , cramped , and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four - wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky , can - do determination . ''   The Jeep marque has been headquartered in Toledo , Ohio , ever since Willys - Overland launched production of the first CJ or Civilian Jeep branded models there in 1945 . Its replacement , the conceptually consistent Jeep Wrangler series , remains in production since 1986 . With its solid axles and open top , the Wrangler has been called the Jeep model that is as central to the brand 's identity as the rear - engined 911 is to Porsche .   At least two Jeep models ( the CJ - 5 and the SJ Wagoneer ) enjoyed extraordinary three - decade production runs of a single body generation .

Sanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester of his senior year at Florida State , yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn . This caused the Florida State Legislature to create the ' Deion Sanders rule ' , whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester .   In 1995 , he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL 's salary cap .

Nick Carraway , a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwest -- who serves as the novel 's narrator -- takes a job in New York as a bond salesman . He rents a small house on Long Island , in the fictional village of West Egg , next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby , a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them ."", ""Contents  ( hide )   1 Historical context   2 Plot summary   3 Major characters   4 Writing and production   5 Cover art   6 Title   7 Themes   8 Reception   9 Legacy and modern analysis   10 Adaptations   10.1 Ballet   10.2 Computer games   10.3 Film and television   10.4 Literature   10.5 Opera   10.6 Radio   10.7 Theater     11 See also   12 Notes   13 References   13.1 Bibliography     14 External links      Historical context ( edit )   Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922 , The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative .

Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book 's plotline within the historical context of the era .   Fitzgerald 's visits to Long Island 's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby 's setting . Today , there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book . One possibility is Land 's End , a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party . Many of the events in Fitzgerald 's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota , and like Nick , he was educated at an Ivy League school , Princeton ( in Nick 's case , Yale ) . Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby , in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved . Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant , and was stationed at Camp Sheridan , in Montgomery , Alabama ."", ""From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time , Gatsby became ( and still is ) deeply in love with Daisy . Even more , he became obsessed with the idea of her , and the ideal of living in the world he saw her living in , as the fulfillment of all the possible dreams he could ever have .   Jordan confides in Nick that the only reason Gatsby bought the mansion is because it was across the bay from Tom and Daisy 's home , and that Gatsby 's extravagant lifestyle and wild parties were an attempt to impress Daisy and raise her curiosity about her `` anonymous '' neighbor across the bay .""]","[""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.
