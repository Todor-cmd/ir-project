what purpose did seasonal monsoon winds have on trade,"['A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone . When located within a monsoon region , this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough . Around 30 ° in both hemispheres , air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high - pressure belts known as subtropical ridges . The subsident ( sinking ) air is relatively dry because as it descends , the temperature increases , but the absolute humidity remains constant , which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass . This warm , dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical ( warm and moist ) air mass . An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion . When it occurs within a trade wind regime , it is known as a trade wind inversion .   The surface air that flows from these subtropical high - pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect . These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere . Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing , these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere . The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums .   As they blow across tropical regions , air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight . Those that develop over land ( continental ) are drier and hotter than those that develop over oceans ( maritime ) , and travel northward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge . Maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses . The one region of the Earth which has an absence of trade winds is the north Indian ocean .   Weather effects ( edit )   Clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres ( 13,000 ft ) in height , and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion .', ""The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the sea '' but also `` return from the sea '' ) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around 30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation , which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta 's voyage in 1565 .   The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all .   By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England 's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of ' trade ' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world 's oceans .

The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase. Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world's oceans for centuries, and enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.""]","The sources provided do not specifically mention the role of seasonal monsoon winds in trade. However, historically, seasonal monsoon winds have been crucial for trade, especially in the Indian Ocean region. These winds allowed for predictable sailing conditions, enabling traders to travel between regions such as the Arabian Peninsula, India, and Southeast Asia. The monsoon winds facilitated the movement of goods, people, and cultural exchanges, significantly impacting trade routes and economic interactions in these areas.",enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,0.0,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.29,,0.9403116631360724

when is the next deadpool movie being released,"[""Noting the release date , Leitch wanted to ensure that the film `` was worthy of a summer tentpole movie , and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films '' , specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film `` bigger '' than the first one . However , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '' of combining that with the increased scope . The film uses Deadpool 's fourth wall - breaking to reference this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh and timely when they come up . '' In May 2017 , Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool 2 to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds , Brolin , and Beetz in an X-Force film . Casting for the characters -- Sunspot , Feral , and Shatterstar -- would take place over the coming months , though Reese denied the accuracy of this report . Later , T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return from the first film as Weasel , and described the sequel as `` even more weaselicious '' than the first . He noted that Reynolds and the writers had `` really put the time in on the script '' to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans . Jack Kesy also joined the cast , as Black Tom Cassidy . In June , Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film .   Filming   Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films . Principal photography began in Vancouver on June 26 , under the working title Love Machine . Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film . At the end of June , Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film . The next month , T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film , and that `` it 's not going to be the same movie in a different location ( like The Hangover Part II ) ."", ""Tim 's brilliant and nobody worked harder on Deadpool than he did . '' A week after Miller 's departure , Fox was looking at David Leitch , Drew Goddard , Magnus Martens , and Rupert Sanders as potential replacements for the director . Leitch was the `` strong frontrunner '' for the role , and signed on to direct a month later . Reynolds , a fan of Leitch 's John Wick , said the director `` really understands those Deadpool sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise from here . '' He added that Leitch `` can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10 -- 15 times what it cost . ''   Pre-production   Reese and Wernick had completed multiple drafts of the script by January 2017 , saying , `` It 's taken different twists and turns , but it 's really coalescing '' ; the film was still on track to begin filming that year . The pair felt a responsibility to explore the team X-Force , which includes Deadpool , Cable , and Domino in the comics , with Reese saying the sequel 's purpose `` is not to set up X-Force ( but ) it will likely set up X-Force . '' He did clarify that though the film will be `` populated with a lot of characters ... it is still Deadpool 's movie '' . The pair confirmed that Stefan Kapičić 's Colossus , Brianna Hildebrand 's Negasonic Teenage Warhead , and Karan Soni 's Dopinder would be returning from the first film to `` make at least an appearance '' , and that the film would not be exploring the details of Cable 's convoluted comic origins . By the next month , it had been noted that there had been few announcements from Fox regarding the film , and that a release date had not yet been set which was seen as unusual for sequels to popular films ( often studios `` announce sequels far too soon and with no idea what will happen '' ) , with the issue deemed to be the film 's script . Reynolds , Reese , and Wernick had been `` bunkered down , working on the script together , trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make '' . At that time , Goddard joined the project to consult on the script .""]","['Deadpool 2 is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 18, 2018.

the south west wind blows across nigeria between,"[""The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun . The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth . Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the obudu plateau or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of cumulonimbus cloud leading to thunderstorms within the airmass .   During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) in the rainy season of Nigeria , mornings are bright and sunny , the sun 's heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents , these currents rise vertically and cumulonimbus clouds are formed , by afternoons to evenings , torrential downpour follows .   The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria .   The nature of this waves changes at about the 15 degrees line . The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds . Nigeria 's northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees . Nigeria 's location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons .   Tropical continental airmass ( edit )   The Tropical Continental Airmass ( CT ) locally known as the harmattan , is a wind originating from North Africa which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria . This airmass dominates Nigeria 's climate during the dry season from December to March ."", ""Due to their location in the tropics , this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands , mountains and the plateau regions standing above this height , a cool mountain climate .   Seasons ( edit )   Nigeria , like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands , has only two seasons . These are the dry season and the rainy season . The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert , locally known as Harmattan , or by its main name , The Tropical Continental ( CT ) airmass , while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean , locally known as the south west wind , or by its main name , The Tropical Maritime ( MT ) airmass . These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the trade winds .   Trade winds ( edit )   Tropical Maritime airmass ( edit )   The tropical maritime airmass ( MT ) is responsible for Nigeria 's rainy season . This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June .

When Arneson was adapting the medieval wargame Chainmail ( 1971 ) to a fantasy setting , a process that with Gary Gygax would lead to Dungeons & Dragons , he saw that the emphasis of the gameplay was moving from large armies to small groups of heroes and eventually to the identification of one player and one character that is essential to role - playing as it was originally conceived . Players became attached to their heroes and did not want them to die every time they lost a die roll . Players were thus given multiple hit points which were incrementally decreased as they took damage . Arneson took the concept , along with armor class , from a set of a naval American Civil War game 's rules ."", ""Rey believes that his conflict will ultimately bring him back to the light side .

who wrote the first declaration of human rights,"[""Kuhrt comments that `` the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof '' of the historicity of Cyrus 's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem , though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts -- an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance .   The German scholar Josef Wiesehöfer summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that `` Many scholars have read into ( ... ) sentences ( from the text of Cylinder ) a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the Judaeans '' and this interpretation was , according to Wiesehöfer , for some scholars a strict belief `` that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder . ''   Human rights ( edit )   The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last Shah of Iran called it `` the world 's first charter of human rights '' . The cylinder was a key symbol of the Shah 's political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights , despite the disagreement of some historians and scholars .  Pahlavi Iranian government 's view ( edit ) Cyrus Cylinder at the center of the official emblem of 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire at Pahlavi Iranian imperial era  The Cyrus Cylinder was dubbed the `` first declaration of human rights '' by the pre-Revolution Iranian government , a reading prominently advanced by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , in a 1967 book , The White Revolution of Iran . The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids . He wrote that `` the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus , which , for its advocacy of humane principles , justice and liberty , must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind . '' The Shah described Cyrus as the first ruler in history to give his subjects `` freedom of opinion and other basic rights '' .

In 1968 , the Shah opened the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights in Tehran by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern Universal Declaration of Human Rights .   In his 1971 Nowruz ( New Year ) speech , the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year , during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy . It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized . The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran 's political system , associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia 's past , and with Cyrus in particular . The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as `` a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create . ''   The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration , and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history . The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities ; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument ( now the Azadi Tower ) in Tehran . The 2,500 year celebrations commenced on October 12 , 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae . On October 14 , the shah 's sister , Princess Ashraf Pahlavi , presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder . The princess asserted that `` the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding , tolerance , courage , compassion and , above all , human liberty '' . The Secretary General accepted the gift , linking the Cylinder with the efforts of the United Nations General Assembly to address `` the question of Respect for Human Rights in Armed Conflict '' . Since then the replica Cylinder has been kept at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on the second floor hallway .

what happens to the rbc in acute hemolytic reaction,"[""Title: Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction\nAcute hemolytic transfusion reaction - wikipedia  Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction  Jump to : navigation , search      This article may be too technical for most readers to understand . Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details . ( January 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction ( AHTR ) is a type of transfusion reaction that is associated with hemolysis . It occurs very soon after the transfusion , and within 24 hrs post-transfusion . It can occur quickly upon transfusing a few milliliters , or up to 1 -- 2 hours post-transfusion .   It is also known as an `` immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction '' . This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies ( IgG , IgM ) . It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood . Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood , facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade . The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) may also occur . The most common cause is clerical error ( i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient ) ."", ""The former results in a severe intravascular hemolysis and the latter typically causes extravascular hemolysis . The reactions are mediated by cytokines like TNF , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein , IL - 1 etc .   Non-immune mediated ( edit )   These occur when RBCs are damaged before transfusion , resulting in hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria . Clinical symptoms are nil or milder .   Diagnosis ( edit )   Differential diagnoses ( edit )    Disseminated intravascular coagulation   Hemolytic anemia   Pulmonary edema   Septic shock    Management ( edit )    In case of antibody - mediated acute hemolytic transfusion reactions ,   Immediately discontinue the transfusion while maintaining venous access for emergency management .

Prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of renal failure may include low - dose dopamine , vigorous hydration with intravenous crystalloid solutions ( e.g. , lactated Ringer 's solution or normal saline ) , and osmotic diuresis with mannitol .   If DIC is documented and bleeding requires treatment , transfusions of frozen plasma , pooled cryoprecipitates for fibrinogen , and / or platelet concentrates may be indicated .     In case of non-antibody mediated AHR   This does not require rigorous management .   Diuresis induced by an infusion of normal saline until the intense red color of hemoglobinuria ceases is usually adequate treatment .

It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood. Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood, facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade. The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may also occur. The most common cause is clerical error (i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient).']","In an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, the donor red blood cells (RBCs) are rapidly destroyed by the host's antibodies, typically due to ABO blood group incompatibility. This reaction can occur very soon after the transfusion, sometimes within a few milliliters of transfusion or up to 1-2 hours post-transfusion. The donor RBCs become coated with IgG antibodies and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system.

Instead , Bullard returned to infantry duty with the French .   The racially motivated rejections of World War I African - American recruits sparked more than two decades of advocacy by African - Americans who wished to enlist and train as military aviators . The effort was led by such prominent civil rights leaders as Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , labor union leader A. Philip Randolph , and Judge William H. Hastie . Finally , on 3 April 1939 , Appropriations Bill Public Law 18 was passed by Congress containing an amendment by Senator Harry H. Schwartz , designating funds for training African - American pilots . The War Department managed to put the money into funds of civilian flight schools willing to train black Americans .   War Department tradition and policy mandated the segregation of African - Americans into separate military units staffed by white officers , as had been done previously with the 9th Cavalry , 10th Cavalry , 24th Infantry Regiment and 25th Infantry Regiment . When the appropriation of funds for aviation training created opportunities for pilot cadets , their numbers diminished the rosters of these older units . In 1941 , the War Department and the Army Air Corps , under pressure -- three months before its transformation into the USAAF -- constituted the first all - black flying unit , the 99th Pursuit Squadron .   Due to the restrictive nature of selection policies , the situation did not seem promising for African - Americans since , in 1940 , the U.S. Census Bureau reported there were only 124 African - American pilots in the nation . The exclusionary policies failed dramatically when the Air Corps received an abundance of applications from men who qualified , even under the restrictive requirements .

what is the most current adobe flash player version,"[""202.223   ?     Mobile platforms ( edit )  Main article : Adobe Integrated Runtime  In 2011 , Flash Player had emerged as the de facto standard for online video publishing on the desktop , with adaptive bitrate video streaming , DRM , and fullscreen support . On mobile devices however , after Apple refused to allow the Flash Player within the inbuilt iOS web browser , Adobe changed strategy , enabling Flash content to be delivered as native mobile applications using the Adobe Integrated Runtime .   Up until 2012 , Flash Player 11 was available for the Android ( ARM Cortex - A8 and above ) , although in June 2012 , Google announced that Android 4.1 ( codenamed Jelly Bean ) would not support Flash by default . Starting in August 2012 , Adobe no longer updates Flash for Android . In spite of this , Adobe Flash is still available to install on Android devices via Adobe 's update archives ( up to Android 4.3 ) .   Flash Player is certified to be supported on a select range of mobile and tablet devices , from Acer , BlackBerry 10 , Dell , HTC , Lenovo , Logitech , LG , Motorola , Samsung , Sharp , SoftBank , Sony ( and Sony Ericsson ) , and Toshiba . As of 2012 , Adobe has stopped browser - based Flash Player development for mobile browsers in favor of HTML5 , however Adobe continues to support Flash content on mobile devices with the Adobe Integrated Runtime , which allows developers to publish content that runs as native applications on certain supported mobile phone platforms .   Version 9 is the most recent version currently available for the Linux / ARM - based Nokia 770 / N800 / N810 Internet tablets running Maemo OS2008 , classic Mac OS and Windows 95 / NT . Version 10 can be run under Windows 98 / Me using KernelEx . HP offers Version 6 of the player for HP - UX . Other versions of the player have been available at some point for OS / 2 , Symbian OS , Palm OS , BeOS and IRIX . The Kodak Easyshare One includes Flash Player .

who designed the garden city of new earswick,"[""There was housing for both workers and managers , in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees . It was founded by the York philanthropist , Joseph Rowntree , who was quoted as saying , `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin , after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .   The village had contemporaries such as Bournville , Saltaire , Port Sunlight and others . This was in sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century , the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree 's report of 1901 , entitled Poverty : a study of town life . It revealed appalling statistics of dark , overcrowded and insanitary housing .   As a result of the report , Joseph Rowntree 's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick , two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York . The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new ' garden ' village and the detailed designs for its first houses . They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City .   The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low , but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested . Houses were open to any working people , not just Rowntree employees . The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick ."", ""Title: New Earswick\nNew Earswick - wikipedia  New Earswick  Jump to : navigation , search    New Earswick     New Earswick New Earswick shown within North Yorkshire     Population   2,737 ( 2011 )     OS grid reference   SE609555     Civil parish     New Earswick       Unitary authority     City of York       Ceremonial county     North Yorkshire       Region     Yorkshire and the Humber       Country   England     Sovereign state   United Kingdom     Post town   YORK     Postcode district   YO32     Dialling code   01904         Police   North Yorkshire     Fire   North Yorkshire     Ambulance   Yorkshire         EU Parliament   Yorkshire and the Humber     UK Parliament     York Outer         List of places   UK   England   Yorkshire   53 ° 59 ′ 31 '' N 1 ° 04 ′ 21 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 53.992020 ° N 1.072380 ° W \ufeff / 53.992020 ; - 1.072380 Coordinates : 53 ° 59 ′ 31 '' N 1 ° 04 ′ 21 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 53.992020 ° N 1.072380 ° W \ufeff / 53.992020 ; - 1.072380     New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire , England , near the River Foss , north of York and south of Haxby .

Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species , that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance `` absurd in the highest possible degree '' . However , he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it , its evolution was perfectly feasible :   ... if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist , each grade being useful to its possessor , as is certainly the case ; if further , the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited , as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory .   He suggested a stepwise evolution from `` an optic nerve merely coated with pigment , and without any other mechanism '' to `` a moderately high stage of perfection '' , and gave examples of existing intermediate steps . Darwin 's suggestions were soon shown to be correct , and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution .   Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors . Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates . Another researcher , G.C. Young , has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions , based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through . All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin 's theory .   Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' ."", ""Title: Evolution of the eye\nEvolution of the eye - wikipedia  Evolution of the eye  Jump to : navigation , search Major stages in the evolution of the eye in vertebrates .  The evolution of the eye is attractive to study , because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms . Complex , image - forming eyes have evolved independently several times . The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion . According his theory , the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells ( so called Pax 6 genes ) appeared probably at once in the life history , at a very early stage of the evolution . Probably , the complex , image forming kinds of eyes are at least five : Chidaria - lens eye , complex eye ; Molluscs - lens eye , everse retina ; Annelids - lens eye , everse retina ; Arthropods - facet eye ; Vertebrate - lens eye , inverse retina   Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion . From before the Cambrian , no evidence of eyes has survived , but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian , and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale . Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners . They vary in their visual acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light , their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colours .

Eyespots can only sense ambient brightness: they can distinguish light from dark, sufficient for photoperiodism and daily synchronization of circadian rhythms. They are insufficient for vision, as they cannot distinguish shapes or determine the direction light is coming from. Eyespots are found in nearly all major animal groups, and are common among unicellular organisms, including euglena. The euglena\'s eyespot, called a stigma, is located at its anterior end. It is a small splotch of red pigment which shades a collection of light sensitive crystals. Together with the leading flagellum, the eyespot allows the organism to move in response to light, often toward the light to assist in photosynthesis,[22] and to predict day and night, the primary function of circadian rhythms. Visual pigments are located in the brains of more complex organisms, and are thought to have a role in synchronising spawning with lunar cycles.

By detecting the subtle changes in night-time illumination, organisms could synchronise the release of sperm and eggs to maximise the probability of fertilisation.[citation needed]']","The first step in the evolution of the eye is theorized to be a patch of photoreceptors. This initial stage involves an optic nerve coated with pigment, without any other mechanism.

where is gall bladder situated in human body,"['It rotates a further 180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen . This process creates the twisted shape of the large intestine .   Function ( edit )   Food from the stomach is allowed into the duodenum through the pylorus by a muscle called the pyloric sphincter .   Digestion ( edit )   The small intestine is where most chemical digestion takes place . Many of the digestive enzymes that act in the small intestine are secreted by the pancreas and liver and enter the small intestine via the pancreatic duct . Pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder enter the small intestine in response to the hormone cholecystokinin , which is produced in the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients . Secretin , another hormone produced in the small intestine , causes additional effects on the pancreas , where it promotes the release of bicarbonate into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach .   The three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are proteins , lipids ( fats ) and carbohydrates :    Proteins are degraded into small peptides and amino acids before absorption . Chemical breakdown begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine . Proteolytic enzymes , including trypsin and chymotrypsin , are secreted by the pancreas and cleave proteins into smaller peptides . Carboxypeptidase , which is a pancreatic brush border enzyme , splits one amino acid at a time . Aminopeptidase and dipeptidase free the end amino acid products .   Lipids ( fats ) are degraded into fatty acids and glycerol . Pancreatic lipase breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides . Pancreatic lipase works with the help of the salts from the bile secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder . Bile salts attach to triglycerides to help emulsify them , which aids access by pancreatic lipase . This occurs because the lipase is water - soluble but the fatty triglycerides are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards each other and away from the watery intestinal surroundings . The bile salts emulsify the triglycerides in the watery surroundings until the lipase can break them into the smaller components that are able to enter the villi for absorption .', ""Such polyps often cause no symptoms and so are often detected in this way .   Tests ( edit )  An ultrasound showing the gallbladder ( central dark area ) with a large gallstone ( white circular area found near the middle ) .  Tests used to investigate for gallbladder disease include blood tests and medical imaging . A full blood count may reveal an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection . Tests such as bilirubin and liver function tests may reveal if there is inflammation linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder , and whether this is associated with inflammation of the liver , and a lipase or amylase may be elvated if there is pancreatitis . Bilirubin may rise when there is obstruction of the flow of bile . A CA 19 - 9 level may be taken to investigate for cholangiocarcinoma .   Ultrasound is often the first medical imaging test performed when gallbladder disease such as gallstones are suspected . An abdominal X-ray or CT scan is another form of imaging that may be used to examine the gallbladder and surrounding organs . Other imaging options include MRCP ( magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ) , ERCP and percutaneous or intraoperative cholangiography . A cholescintigraphy scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder .   Society and Culture ( edit )   To have ' gall ' is associated with bold behaviour , whereas to have ' bile ' is associated with bitterness .   In the Chinese language , the gallbladder ( Chinese : 膽 ) is associated with courage and a myriad of related idioms , including using terms such as `` a body completely ( of ) gall '' ( Chinese : 渾身 是 膽 ) to describe a brave person , and `` single gallbladder hero '' ( Chinese : 孤膽 英雄 ) to describe a lone hero .   In the Zangfu theory of Chinese medicine , the gallbladder not only has a digestive role , but is seen as the seat of decision - making .   Other animals ( edit )   Most vertebrates have gallbladders , but the form and arrangement of the bile ducts may vary considerably . In many species , for example , there are several separate ducts running to the intestine , rather than the single common bile duct found in humans .""]","['In vertebrates, the gallbladder is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine.

what is the main mineral in lithium batteries,"[""Li would therefore have a content of up to 96.25 % .       view   talk     references in Wikidata     Lithium ( from Greek : λίθος , translit . lithos , lit . ' stone ' ) is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3 . It is a soft , silvery - white alkali metal . Under standard conditions , it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element . Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable , and is stored in mineral oil . When cut open , it exhibits a metallic luster , but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . It never occurs freely in nature , but only in ( usually ionic ) compounds , such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium . Due to its solubility as an ion , it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines . Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride .   The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability , since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides . Because of its relative nuclear instability , lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light : it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common . For related reasons , lithium has important uses in nuclear physics . The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man - made nuclear reaction , and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons .   Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications , including heat - resistant glass and ceramics , lithium grease lubricants , flux additives for iron , steel and aluminium production , lithium batteries , and lithium - ion batteries . These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production .   Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts ; its functions are uncertain . Lithium salts have proven to be useful as a mood - stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans ."", 'Glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware . Lithium carbonate ( Li CO ) is generally used in this application because it converts to the oxide upon heating .   Electrical and electronics ( edit )   Late in the 20th century , lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes , because of its high electrode potential . Because of its low atomic mass , it has a high charge - and power - to - weight ratio . A typical lithium - ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell , compared with 2.1 volts for lead - acid or 1.5 volts for zinc - carbon cells . Lithium - ion batteries , which are rechargeable and have a high energy density , should not be confused with lithium batteries , which are disposable ( primary ) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode . Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium - ion polymer battery , lithium iron phosphate battery , and the nanowire battery .   Lubricating greases ( edit )  Main article : Lithium grease  The third most common use of lithium is in greases . Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and , when heated with a fat , produces a soap made of lithium stearate . Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils , and it is used to manufacture all - purpose , high - temperature lubricating greases .   Metallurgy ( edit )   Lithium ( e.g. as lithium carbonate ) is used as an additive to continuous casting mould flux slags where it increases fluidity , a use which accounts for 5 % of global lithium use ( 2011 ) . Lithium compounds are also used as additives ( fluxes ) to foundry sand for iron casting to reduce veining .   Lithium ( as lithium fluoride ) is used as an additive to aluminium smelters ( Hall -- Héroult process ) , reducing melting temperature and increasing electrical resistance , a use which accounts for 3 % of production ( 2011 ) .   When used as a flux for welding or soldering , metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities . Alloys of the metal with aluminium , cadmium , copper and manganese are used to make high - performance aircraft parts ( see also Lithium - aluminium alloys ) .']","['Late in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential.

right to property according to the constitution of india is a,"[""Many constitutional amendments to Part III of the constitution were made deleting or adding or diluting the fundamental rights before the judgement of Golaknath case ( Constitutional amendments 1 , 4 , 7 and 16 ) and after the validity of 24th constitutional amendment is upheld by the Supreme Court ( Constitutional amendments 25 , 42 , 44 , 50 , 77 , 81 , 85 , 86 , 93 and 97 ) .   Validity of Article 31B ( edit )   Articles 31A and Article 31B are added by First constitutional amendment in 1951 . Article 31B says that any acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule of the constitution by the Parliament can override the fundamental rights and such laws can not be repealed or made void by the judiciary on the grounds of violating fundamental rights . Thus fundamental rights given in Part III are not equally applicable in each state / region and can be made different by making additions / deletions to Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments . In 2007 , Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review for the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule . Apex court also stated it shall examine laws included in the Ninth Schedule after 1973 for any incompatibility with the basic structure doctrine .   Amendment to Article 31C ( edit )   Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment , had changed Article 31C of the constitution to accord precedence to the Directive Principles ( earlier applicable only to clauses b & c of Article 39 ) over the fundamental rights of individuals . In Minerva Mills v. Union of India case , supreme court ruled that the amendment to the Article 31C is not valid and ultra vires .   Right to property ( edit )   The Constitution originally provided for the right to property under Articles 19 and 31 . Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire , hold and dispose of property . Article 31 provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law . '' It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes .   The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times ."", ""The phrases `` security of State '' , `` public order '' and `` morality '' are of wide implication . People of alternate sexuality are criminalised in India with prison term up to 10 years . The meaning of phrases like `` reasonable restrictions '' and `` the interest of public order '' have not been explicitly stated in the constitution , and this ambiguity leads to unnecessary litigation . The freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms is exercised , but in some cases , these meetings are broken up by the police through the use of non-fatal methods .   `` Freedom of press '' has not been included in the right to freedom , which is necessary for formulating public opinion and to make freedom of expression more legitimate . Employment of child labour in hazardous job environments has been reduced , but their employment even in non-hazardous jobs , including their prevalent employment as domestic help violates the spirit and ideals of the constitution . More than 16.5 million children are employed and working in India . India was ranked 88 out of 159 in 2005 , according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians worldwide . But in 2014 , India has improved marginally to a rank of 85 . The right to equality in matters regarding public employment shall not be conferred to overseas citizens of India , according to the Citizenship ( Amendment ) Bill , 2003 .   As per Article 19 of Part III of the Indian constitution , the fundamental rights of people such as freedom of speech and expression , gathering peaceably without arms and forming associations or unions shall not effect the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India but not unity of India . The words sovereignty and integrity are the qualities to be cultivated / emulated by Indian people as urged by the Indian constitution but not used related to territory of India . Article 1 of Part 1 of the Indian constitution , defines India ( Bharat ) as union of states . In nutshell , India is its people not its land as enshrined in its constitution .   Since speedy trial is not the constitutional right of the citizens , the cases involving violations of fundamental rights take inordinate time for resolution by the Supreme Court which is against the legal maxim ' justice delayed is justice denied ' .   Amendments ( edit )   Changes to the fundamental rights require a constitutional amendment , which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of Parliament .""]","['The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times.

what is the use of adobe flash cs3 professional,"[""In 2007 , Adobe 's first version release was Adobe Flash CS3 Professional , the ninth major version of Flash . It introduced the ActionScript 3.0 programming language , which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with Flash . Adobe Flex Builder ( built on Eclipse ) targeted the enterprise application development market , and was also released the same year . Flex Builder included the Flex SDK , a set of components that included charting , advanced UI , and data services ( Flex Data Services ) .   In 2008 , Adobe released the tenth version of Flash , Adobe Flash CS4 . Flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the Flash editor , adding a motion editor panel ( similar to Adobe After Effects ) , inverse kinematics ( bones ) , basic 3D object animation , object - based animation , and other text and graphics features . Flash Player 10 included an in - built 3D engine ( without GPU acceleration ) that allowed basic object transformations in 3D space ( position , rotation , scaling ) .   Also in 2008 , Adobe released the first version of Adobe Integrated Runtime ( later re-branded as Adobe AIR ) , a runtime engine that replaced Flash Player , and provided additional capabilities to the ActionScript 3.0 language to build desktop and mobile applications . With AIR , developers could access the file system ( the user 's files and folders ) , and connected devices suxh as joystick , gamepad and sensors for the first time .   In 2011 , Adobe Flash Player 11 was released , and with it the first version of Stage3D , allowing GPU - accelerated 3D rendering for Flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X . Adobe further improved 3D capabilities from 2011 to 2013 , adding support for 3D rendering on Android and iOS platforms , alpha - channels , compressed textures , texture atlases , and other features . Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64 - bit computers , and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using AIR Native Extensions ( ANE ) .   In 2014 , Adobe AIR reached a milestone with over 100,000 unique applications built , and over 1 billion installations logged across the world ( May 2014 ) ."", ""Fox Broadcasting Company launched The Simpsons using FutureSplash .   Macromedia ( edit )   In November 1996 , FutureSplash was acquired by Macromedia , and Macromedia re-branded and released FutureSplash Animator as Macromedia Flash 1.0 . Flash was a two - part system , a graphics and animation editor known as Macromedia Flash , and a player known as Macromedia Flash Player .   FutureSplash Animator was an animation tool originally developed for pen - based computing devices . Due to the small size of the FutureSplash Viewer , it was particularly suited for download on the Web . Macromedia distributed Flash Player as a free browser plugin in order to quickly gain market share . By 2005 , more computers worldwide had Flash Player installed than any other Web media format , including Java , QuickTime , RealNetworks and Windows Media Player .   Macromedia upgraded the Flash system between 1996 and 1999 adding MovieClips , Actions ( the precursor to ActionScript ) , Alpha transparency , and other features . As Flash matured , Macromedia 's focus shifted from marketing it as a graphics and media tool to promoting it as a Web application platform , adding scripting and data access capabilities to the player while attempting to retain its small footprint .   In 2000 , the first major version of ActionScript was developed , and released with Flash 5 . Actionscript 2.0 was released with Flash MX 2004 and supported object - oriented programming , improved UI components and other programming features . The last version of Flash released by Macromedia was Flash 8 , which focused on graphical upgrades such as filters ( blur , drop shadow , etc . ) , blend modes ( similar to Adobe Photoshop ) , and advanced features for FLV video .

where do they grow hops in the us,"[""Hop cones contain different oils , such as lupulin , a yellowish , waxy substance , an oleoresin , that imparts flavour and aroma to beer . Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone , which possess antibiotic properties , suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer 's yeast to grow . After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded .   Migrant labor and social impact ( edit )  Hops harvest in the Kingdom of Bohemia ( 1898 ) Hops harvest in Skåne , Sweden in 1937  The need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop - growing had a big social impact . Around the world , the labor - intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest . Whole families would partake and live in hoppers ' huts , with even the smallest children helping in the fields . The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham 's Of Human Bondage and a large part of George Orwell 's A Clergyman 's Daughter contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest . In England , many of those picking hops in Kent were from eastern areas of London . This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside . People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the Malvern area of Worcestershire . Some photographs have been preserved .   Particularly in Kent , because of a shortage of small - denomination coin of the realm , many growers issued their own currency to those doing the labor . In some cases , the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images , making them quite beautiful .   In the US , Prohibition had a major impact on hops productions , but remnants of this significant industry in West and Northwest US are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive throughout Sonoma County , among others . Florian Dauenhauer , of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County , became a manufacturer of hop - harvesting machines in 1940 , in part because of the hop industry 's importance to the county . This mechanization helped destroy the local industry by enabling large - scale mechanized production , which moved to larger farms in other areas . Dauenhauer Manufacturing remains a current producer of hop harvesting machines ."", ""Wye College have also been responsible for breeding hop varieties that will grow with only 12 hours of daily light for the South African hop farmers . Wye College was closed in 2009 but the legacy of their hop breeding programs , particularly that of the dwarf varieties , is continuing as already the U.S.A. private and public breeding programs are using their stock material .   Particular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles , for example pale lagers are usually brewed with European ( often German , Polish or Czech ) noble hop varieties such as Saaz , Hallertau and Strissel Spalt . British ales use hop varieties such as Fuggles , Goldings and W.G.V. North American beers often use Cascade hops , Columbus hops , Centennial hops , Willamette , Amarillo hops and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new hop varieties , including dwarf hop varieties .   Hops from New Zealand , such as Pacific Gem , Motueka and Nelson Sauvin , are used in a `` Pacific Pale Ale '' style of beer with increasing production in 2014 .   Noble hops ( edit )  Mature hops growing in a hop yard in Germany  The term `` noble hops '' traditionally refers to varieties of hops which are low in bitterness and high in aroma . They are the European cultivars or races Hallertau , Tettnanger , Spalt , and Saaz .   Their low relative bitterness but strong aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European - style lagers , such as Pilsener , Dunkel , and Oktoberfest / Märzen . In beer , they are considered aroma hops ( as opposed to bittering hops ) ; see Pilsner Urquell as a classic example of the Bohemian Pilsener style , which showcases noble hops .   As with grapes , the location where hops are grown affects the hops ' characteristics . Much as Dortmunder beer may within the EU be labelled `` Dortmunder '' only if it has been brewed in Dortmund , noble hops may officially be considered `` noble '' only if they were grown in the areas for which the hop varieties ( races ) were named .

However , petroleum products are unavailable to most Nigerians and are quite costly , because almost all of the oil extracted by the multinational oil companies is refined overseas , while only a limited quantity is supplied to Nigerians themselves .

in which sea pearl is found in india,"[""The rarity of the black cultured pearl is now a `` comparative '' issue . The black cultured pearl is rare when compared to Chinese freshwater cultured pearls , and Japanese and Chinese akoya cultured pearls , and is more valuable than these pearls . However , it is more abundant than the South Sea pearl , which is more valuable than the black cultured pearl . This is simply because the black pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera is far more abundant than the elusive , rare , and larger south sea pearl oyster Pinctada maxima , which can not be found in lagoons , but which must be dived for in a rare number of deep ocean habitats or grown in hatcheries .   Black pearls are very rarely black : they are usually shades of green , purple , aubergine , blue , grey , silver or peacock ( a mix of several shades , like a peacock 's feather ) .   Black cultured pearls from the black pearl oyster -- Pinctada margaritifera -- are not South Sea pearls , although they are often mistakenly described as black South Sea pearls . In the absence of an official definition for the pearl from the black oyster , these pearls are usually referred to as `` black pearls '' .   The correct definition of a South Sea pearl -- as described by CIBJO and GIA -- is a pearl produced by the Pinctada maxima pearl oyster . South Sea pearls are the color of their host Pinctada maxima oyster -- and can be white , silver , pink , gold , cream , and any combination of these basic colors , including overtones of the various colors of the rainbow displayed in the pearl nacre of the oyster shell itself .   South Sea pearls are the largest and rarest of the cultured pearls -- making them the most valuable . Prized for their exquisitely beautiful ' orient ' or lustre , South Sea pearls are now farmed in various parts of the world where the Pinctada maxima oysters can be found , with the finest South Sea pearls being produced by Paspaley along the remote coastline of North - Western Australia . White and silver colored South Sea pearls tend to come from the Broome area of Australia , while golden colored ones are more prevalent in the Philippines and Indonesia ."", ""A few species produce pearls that can be of interest as gemstones . These species include the bailer shell Melo , the giant clam Tridacna , various scallop species , Pen shells Pinna , and the Haliotis iris species of abalone . Pearls of abalone , or pāua , are mabe pearls , or blister pearls , unique to New Zealand waters and are commonly referred to as ' blue pearls ' . They are admired for their incredible luster and naturally bright vibrant colors that are often compared to opal . Another example is the conch pearl ( sometimes referred to simply as the ' pink pearl ' ) , which is found very rarely growing between the mantle and the shell of the queen conch or pink conch , Strombus gigas , a large sea snail or marine gastropod from the Caribbean Sea . These pearls , which are often pink in color , are a by - product of the conch fishing industry , and the best of them display a shimmering optical effect related to chatoyance known as ' flame structure ' .   Somewhat similar gastropod pearls , this time more orange in hue , are ( again very rarely ) found in the horse conch Pleuroploca gigantea .   The second largest pearl known was found in the Philippines in 1934 and is known as the Pearl of Lao Tzu . It is a naturally occurring , non-nacreous , calcareous concretion ( pearl ) from a giant clam . Because it did not grow in a pearl oyster it is not pearly ; instead the surface is glossy like porcelain . Other pearls from giant clams are known to exist , but this is a particularly large one weighing 14 lb ( 6.4 kg ) .   The largest known pearl ( also from a giant clam ) was found in the Philippines as well by a fisherman from Puerto Princesa , Palawan Island . The enormous pearl is 30 cm wide ( 1 ft ) , 67 cm long ( 2.2 ft ) and weighs 75 lb ( 34 kg ) .""]","[""For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.[29][30][31] Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions.[30][31] Starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea.[citation needed] In the 14th-century Arabian Sea, the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver's waist.[citation needed]""]","The sources provided do not specifically mention which sea pearls are found in India. However, South Sea pearls, which are produced by the Pinctada maxima oyster, are farmed in various parts of the world, including regions where these oysters can be found. While the sources do not explicitly state that South Sea pearls are found in India, it is possible that pearl farming or natural occurrences could exist in Indian waters, particularly given the country's extensive coastline.",the Indian Ocean,0.0,1.0,0.7142857142857143,0.0,0.0,0.0

'' Terri Schwartz of IGN also called Driver 's performance `` spectacular '' , noting that `` his performance adds great depth to a character who could have come off as one - dimensional , and the implications of his arc leave a viewer with plenty to think about after they leave the theater .

It rejoined the organization in January 2016 , but announced another `` temporary suspension '' of its membership at year - end when OPEC requested a 5 percent production cut .   Some commentators consider that the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq , due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 -- 2004 . But this is not borne out by the minutes of OPEC meetings , as no US representative attended in an official capacity .   Observers ( edit )   Since the 1980s , representatives from Egypt , Mexico , Norway , Oman , Russia , and other oil - exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers .

Leadership and decision - Making ( edit )  OPEC Conference delegates at Swissotel , Quito , Ecuador , December 2010 See also : List of Secretaries General of OPEC  The OPEC Conference is the supreme authority of the organization , and consists of delegations normally headed by the oil ministers of member countries . The chief executive of the organization is the OPEC Secretary General . The Conference ordinarily meets at the Vienna headquarters , at least twice a year and in additional extraordinary sessions when necessary . It generally operates on the principles of unanimity and `` one member , one vote '' , with each country paying an equal membership fee into the annual budget . However , since Saudi Arabia is by far the largest and most - profitable oil exporter in the world , with enough capacity to function as the traditional swing producer to balance the global market , it serves as `` OPEC 's de facto leader '' .

The song is known for its `` la la la '' hook .     Problems playing this file ? See media help .     `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' is a `` robotic '' midtempo dance - pop song , with a tempo of 126 beats per minute . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing , Minogue 's vocal range spans from C to D. Minogue chants a `` la la la '' hook in the song , which is often heralded as its most appealing part . BBC Radio 2 noted that the composition of the song is `` deceptively simple , but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music . '' They described the song 's bassline as `` pulsing , '' and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk . The song does not follow the common verse - chorus structure and is instead composed of numerous `` misplaced sections . '' Dennis reasoned that these sections `` somehow work together '' as she and Davis `` did n't try to force any structure after the event . The seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into something bigger than any of us . '' Likewise , Davis commented : `` It breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the ' la 's ' -- that is what confused my publisher ( Fuller ) when he first heard it . ''   Through the lyrics of the song , its singer expresses an obsession with an anonymous figure . Dorian Lynskey from The Guardian termed the song a `` mystery '' as Minogue never reveals the identity of her object of infatuation . The critic suggested that the person Minogue is referring to is either `` a partner , an evasive one - night stand or someone who does n't know she exists . '' Writing for the same newspaper , Everett True identified a `` darker element '' in the simple lyrics and felt this sentiment was echoed in Minogue 's restrained vocals .""]","['""Can\'t Get You Out of My Head"" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eighth studio album, titled Fever, which she released in 2001.

who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"[""In 1937 , Tyrone Guthrie directed Laurence Olivier in a Jones - inspired Hamlet at The Old Vic . Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play .   In the 1950s , Lacan 's structuralist theories about Hamlet were first presented in a series of seminars given in Paris and later published in `` Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in Hamlet '' . Lacan postulated that the human psyche is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of Hamlet shed light on human desire . His point of departure is Freud 's Oedipal theories , and the central theme of mourning that runs through Hamlet . In Lacan 's analysis , Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of phallus -- the cause of his inaction -- and is increasingly distanced from reality `` by mourning , fantasy , narcissism and psychosis '' , which create holes ( or lack ) in the real , imaginary , and symbolic aspects of his psyche . Lacan 's theories influenced literary criticism of Hamlet because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of semantics to explore the play 's psychological landscape .   In the Bloom 's Shakespeare Through the Ages volume on Hamlet , editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy : `` For once , Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet : it will not stick , and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot , who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet , or so he said . Who can believe Eliot , when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure ? '' The book also notes James Joyce 's interpretation , stating that he `` did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses , where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare , in this play , with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless , thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet . ''"", ""English poet John Milton was an early admirer of Shakespeare , and took evident inspiration from his work . As John Kerrigan discusses , Milton originally considered writing his epic poem Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) as a tragedy . While Milton did not ultimately go that route , the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy , and of Hamlet in particular . As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues , Paradise Lost 's Satan `` undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet - like avenger into a Claudius - like usurper , '' a plot device that supports Milton 's larger Republican internationalist project . The poem also reworks theatrical language from Hamlet , especially around the idea of `` putting on '' certain dispositions , as when Hamlet puts on `` an antic disposition , '' similarly to the Son in Paradise Lost who `` can put on / ( God 's ) terrors . ''   Henry Fielding 's Tom Jones , published about 1749 , describes a visit to Hamlet by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge , with similarities to the `` play within a play '' . In contrast , Goethe 's Bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship , written between 1776 and 1796 , not only has a production of Hamlet at its core but also creates parallels between the ghost and Wilhelm Meister 's dead father . In the early 1850s , in Pierre , Herman Melville focuses on a Hamlet - like character 's long development as a writer . Ten years later , Dickens 's Great Expectations contains many Hamlet - like plot elements : it is driven by revenge - motivated actions , contains ghost - like characters ( Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham ) , and focuses on the hero 's guilt . Academic Alexander Welsh notes that Great Expectations is an `` autobiographical novel '' and `` anticipates psychoanalytic readings of Hamlet itself '' . About the same time , George Eliot 's The Mill on the Floss was published , introducing Maggie Tulliver `` who is explicitly compared with Hamlet '' though `` with a reputation for sanity '' .   L. Frank Baum 's first published short story was `` They Played a New Hamlet '' ( 1895 ) .""]","[""The story of Shakespeare's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest.

where does the story the great gatsby take place,"[""Like Gatsby , Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted , even as she led him toward everything he despised .   In her book Careless People : Murder , Mayhem and the Invention of ' The Great Gatsby ( 2013 ) , Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall - Mills Case . Based on her forensic search for clues , she asserts that the two victims in the Hall - Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby .   Plot summary ( edit )   The main events of the novel take place in the summer of 1922 . Nick Carraway , a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwest -- who serves as the novel 's narrator -- takes a job in New York as a bond salesman . He rents a small house on Long Island , in the fictional village of West Egg , next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby , a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them . Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin , Daisy Fay Buchanan , and her husband , Tom , a college acquaintance of Nick 's . They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker , an attractive , cynical young golfer with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship . She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress , Myrtle Wilson , who lives in the `` valley of ashes '' , an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City . Not long after this revelation , Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment Tom keeps for his affairs with Myrtle and others . At Tom 's New York apartment , a vulgar and bizarre party takes place . It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle 's nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy 's name several times .  The Plaza Hotel in the early - 1920s  As the summer progresses , Nick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby 's parties . Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party , and they meet Gatsby himself , an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War ."", ""The play failed miserably , and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production . The stories were , in his words , `` all trash and it nearly broke my heart , '' although included among those stories was `` Winter Dreams '' , which Fitzgerald later described as `` a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea '' .   After the birth of their child , the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck , New York , on Long Island , in October 1922 . The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald 's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner , actor Lew Fields , and comedian Ed Wynn . These figures were all considered to be `` new money '' , unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula , places which were home to many of New York 's wealthiest established families , and which sat across the bay from Great Neck . This real - life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for `` West Egg '' and `` East Egg '' . In this novel , Great Neck ( King 's Point ) became the `` new money '' peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington ( Sands Point ) the old - money East Egg . Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby 's home , such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers , since demolished .   By mid-1923 , Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel but discarded most of his new story as a false start , some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story `` Absolution '' .   Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924 . Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger , `` Out of woods at last and starting novel . '' He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a `` consciously artistic achievement '' and a `` purely creative work -- not trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world . '' He added later , during editing , that he felt `` an enormous power in me now , more than I 've ever had . '' Soon after this burst of inspiration , work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera , where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed .""]","[""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.

That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby's fortune.[5] Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book's plotline within the historical context of the era.[6]"", ""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.
