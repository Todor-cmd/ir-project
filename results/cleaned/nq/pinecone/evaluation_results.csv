what purpose did seasonal monsoon winds have on trade,"[""The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the sea '' but also `` return from the sea '' ) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around 30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation , which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta 's voyage in 1565 .   The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all .   By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England 's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of ' trade ' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world 's oceans .   Cause ( edit )  3D map showing Hadley cells in relationship to trade winds on the surface . See also : Air mass , Hadley cell , Humidity , Intertropical Convergence Zone , Monsoon , Monsoon trough , Near - equatorial trough , and Prevailing winds  As part of the Hadley cell circulation , surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles . A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone ."", 'Maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses . The one region of the Earth which has an absence of trade winds is the north Indian ocean .   Weather effects ( edit )   Clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres ( 13,000 ft ) in height , and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion . Trade winds originate more from the direction of the poles ( northeast in the Northern Hemisphere , southeast in the Southern Hemisphere ) during the cold season , and are stronger in the winter than the summer . As an example , the windy season in the Guianas , which lie at low latitudes in South America , occurs between January and April . When the phase of the Arctic oscillation ( AO ) is warm , trade winds are stronger within the tropics . The cold phase of the AO leads to weaker trade winds . When the trade winds are weaker , more extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics , such as Central America .   During mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere ( July ) , the westward - moving trade winds south of the northward - moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean sea into southeastern North America ( Florida and Gulf Coast ) . When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land , rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets . Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates . Although the Southeast USA has some of the cleanest air in North America , much of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida . Since 1970 , dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa . There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year . Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida , primarily since the 1970s .

However , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '' of combining that with the increased scope . The film uses Deadpool 's fourth wall - breaking to reference this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh and timely when they come up .

where did the idea of fortnite come from,"[""Development   History   Fortnite was first revealed at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards ( VGA ) , with Epic 's former design director Cliff Bleszinski introducing a trailer for the game . Donald Mustard , creative lead at Epic , said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea , before we even made the game '' . The title , which started out as an internal game jam project , represents a departure from the company 's previous work . As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event , Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite , describing it as `` a world where you explore , you scavenge , you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget , he also echoed these statements , claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that , right ? But creatively for the team , Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' , and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons . ''   As the game was at its very preliminary stages at the VGA reveal , the goal of this reveal was to seek public interest in the title and potential publishing partners as to decide on the game 's release platforms and timeframe . During the July 2012 San Diego Comic Con , Epic announced that Fortnite would be an exclusive personal computer title , and the first one to be developed by Epic using their new Unreal 4 game engine , with a planned release in 2013 . The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time ."", ""The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time . They further opted for personal computer exclusivity to avoid the difficulty of having to go through console certification , and as they planned to be constantly monitoring and tweaking the game , acting as a dungeon master , the personal computer approach would allow them to do this without restrictions normally set by console manfuctures . Bleszinski later clarified that they would not rule out release on other platforms as they developed the title .  Fortnite cosplayers at Gamescom 2017  Fortnite 's development was spread among several of Epic 's satellite studios , and was also co-developed by the Polish studio People Can Fly , which had worked with Epic previously on earlier games , and had been fully acquired by Epic sometime in 2012 . People Can Fly were briefly renamed Epic Games Poland in 2013 as to align with Epic 's other studios . By March 2014 , there were about 90 developers working on the game . People Can Fly later returned to being an independent studio and their own name in 2015 , but continued to help Epic with Fortnite 's development .   During Fortnite 's development , Epic had seen the game industry shifting to games as a service model . To help with this transition , the company brought in Tencent who had several games operating under this model . As part of this agreement , Tencent bought a significant share of ownership in Epic Games through stock acquisition around June 2012 . The shifting of Epic 's approach through Tencent led to the departure of some high - level staff later that year , including Bleszinski . Fortnite was seen as the spearhead for Epic 's games - as - a-service model as they collaborated with Tencent . This caused some road bumps in the development of Fortnite , according to Mustard . Fortnite 's development was also slowed as it was used as the testing ground for the new features of the Unreal 4 engine .   By November 2013 , Epic confirmed that Fortnite would not release that year , nor offered a target released date , though affirmed the game was still in development by several of its studios ."", ""At the time of the start of early access , Gearbox Software helped distribute the game on physical media .   With the popularity of Fortnite Battle Royale , which was first released in early access around September 2017 and gained considerable attention by early 2018 , Epic split off a separate development team to focus on improvements for this mode . Epic said that their attention to Fortnite was causing some of their other games to see lower player populations , leading them to reduce development efforts on these games , particularly Paragon . By the end of January 2018 , Epic announced it was shutting down Paragon by April of that year , providing refunds to all players . Players on a Fortnite - dedicated Reddit forum had expressed concerns that a similar fate could befall the Save the World mode of Fortnite , as externally , the Save the World mode has not received the same attention in providing updates and improvements compared to the Battle Royale mode since that mode 's release . Epic 's Ed Zobrist said that as of March 2018 that the retention rates for `` Save the World '' have been high , and have grown since the release of Fortnite Battle Royale , and the company has since improved communications with the player base , such as providing development road maps and known bug lists .   Art and design   In their initial prototypes of the game , Epic had used creepier and darker designs for the husks and other enemies . Bleszinski said that they found this to create an `` exhaustive environment '' that was too grim , and designed to take the design in a more cartoonish approach , while still remaining creepy , so that players would enjoy spending time in the game 's world , without competing with games like DayZ . They used works from Pixar , Tim Burton , and Looney Tunes as inspiration for the designs .   Fortnite uses procedural generation to build out the maps for each mission .

Sporadic or non-traditional users of the shortwave bands may include :    Clandestine stations . These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces ."", 'Additionally , international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC - allocated bands or use off - channel frequencies . This is done for practical reasons , or to attract attention in crowded bands ( 60m , 49m , 40m , 41m , 31m , 25m ) .   The new digital audio broadcasting format for shortwave DRM operates 10 kHz or 20 kHz channels . There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM , as it mainly transmitted in 10 kHz format .   The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and over-the - horizon radar .

For example , during the attempted coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , when his access to communications was limited ( e.g. his phones were cut off , etc . ) , Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the BBC World Service on shortwave .   Low - cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world . Simple shortwave regenerative receivers can be easily built with a few parts .   In many countries ( particularly in most developing nations and in the Eastern bloc during the Cold War era ) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread ( in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave ) .   Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery - operated , making them useful in difficult circumstances . Newer technology includes hand - cranked radios which provide power without batteries .   Shortwave radios can be used in situations where Internet or satellite communications service is temporarily or long - term unavailable ( or unaffordable ) .   Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM ( 88 -- 108 MHz ) .', ""Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas ; sometimes entire continents or beyond .

The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa . Temperatures can climb as high as 35 ° C ( 95.0 ° F ) over west Africa during this time . Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as 48 ° C ( 118.4 ° F ) in cities like Maiduguri .   The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria ( between March to May ) . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of West Africa , is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land . This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) in turn , causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time ( around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria ) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass ( Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) ) , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria .

The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth . Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the obudu plateau or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of cumulonimbus cloud leading to thunderstorms within the airmass .   During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) in the rainy season of Nigeria , mornings are bright and sunny , the sun 's heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents , these currents rise vertically and cumulonimbus clouds are formed , by afternoons to evenings , torrential downpour follows .   The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria .   The nature of this waves changes at about the 15 degrees line . The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds . Nigeria 's northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees . Nigeria 's location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons .   Tropical continental airmass ( edit )   The Tropical Continental Airmass ( CT ) locally known as the harmattan , is a wind originating from North Africa which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria . This airmass dominates Nigeria 's climate during the dry season from December to March ."", ""Due to their location in the tropics , this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands , mountains and the plateau regions standing above this height , a cool mountain climate .   Seasons ( edit )   Nigeria , like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands , has only two seasons . These are the dry season and the rainy season . The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert , locally known as Harmattan , or by its main name , The Tropical Continental ( CT ) airmass , while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean , locally known as the south west wind , or by its main name , The Tropical Maritime ( MT ) airmass .

Trade winds ( edit )   Tropical Maritime airmass ( edit )   The tropical maritime airmass ( MT ) is responsible for Nigeria 's rainy season . This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June . Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat , of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) known as the harmattan . The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) , is caused by the sun 's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere . This shift begins from February and ends in June , when the sun is fully overhead , at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .

In his 1971 Nowruz ( New Year ) speech , the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year , during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy . It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized . The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran 's political system , associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia 's past , and with Cyrus in particular . The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as `` a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create . ''   The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration , and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history . The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities ; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument ( now the Azadi Tower ) in Tehran . The 2,500 year celebrations commenced on October 12 , 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae .

Significance and characteristics ( edit )   The fundamental rights were included in the constitution because they were considered essential for the development of the personality of every individual and to preserve human dignity . The writers of the constitution regarded democracy of no avail if civil liberties , like freedom of speech and religion were not recognised and protected by the State . According to them , `` democracy '' is , in essence , a government by opinion and therefore , the means of formulating public opinion should be secured to the people of a democratic nation .

who was the governor general of india when country became independent,"[""The governor - general ( now also the viceroy ) headed the central government of India , which administered the provinces of British India , including the Punjab , Bengal , Bombay , Madras , the United Provinces , and others . However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally sovereign princely states or `` native states '' , whose relationship was not with the British government , but directly with the monarch . To reflect the governor - general 's role as the representative of the monarch to the feudal rulers of the princely states , from 1858 the term Viceroy and Governor - General of India ( known in short as the Viceroy of India ) was applied to him .   The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor - general continued to exist in each country separately -- until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively .   Until 1858 , the governor - general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British government ; the Secretary of State for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of his powers . After 1947 , the sovereign continued to appoint the governor - general , but did so on the advice of the Indian government .   Governors - General served at the pleasure of the sovereign , though the practice was to have them serve five - year terms . Governors - General could have their commission rescinded ; and if one was removed , or left , a provisional governor - general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen . The first Governor - General of British India was Warren Hastings , and the first Governor - General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten .

Lord Mountbatten addressing the Chamber of Princes as Crown Representative in the 1940s  The Governor - General originally had power only over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal . The Regulating Act , however , granted them additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence . The other Presidencies of the East India Company ( Madras , Bombay and Bencoolen ) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the Governor - General and Council of Fort William .   The powers of the Governor - General , in respect of foreign affairs , were increased by the India Act 1784 . The Act provided that the other Governors under the East India Company could not declare war , make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the Governor - General or by the Company 's Court of Directors .   While the Governor - General thus became the controller of foreign policy in India , he was not the explicit head of British India . That status came only with the Charter Act 1833 , which granted him `` superintendence , direction and control of the whole civil and military Government '' of all of British India . The Act also granted legislative powers to the Governor - General and Council .   After 1858 , the Governor - General ( now usually known as the Viceroy ) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the Sovereign 's representative . India was divided into numerous provinces , each under the head of a Governor , Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator . Governors were appointed by the British Government , to whom they were directly responsible ; Lieutenant Governors , Chief Commissioners , and Administrators , however , were appointed by and were subordinate to the Viceroy . The Viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers : the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Maharaja of Mysore , the Maharaja ( Scindia ) of Gwalior , the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad ( Gaekwar ) Maharaja of Baroda ."", ""Only the first and last Governors - General -- Warren Hastings and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari -- as well as some provisional Governors - General , had no honorific titles at all .   Flag ( edit )  Flag of the Governor General of India ( 1947 -- 50 )  From around 1885 , the Viceroy of India was allowed to fly a Union Flag augmented in the centre with the ' Star of India ' surmounted by a Crown . This flag was not the Viceroy 's personal flag ; it was also used by Governors , Lieutenant Governors , Chief Commissioners and other British officers in India . When at sea , only the Viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast , while other officials flew it from the foremast .   From 1947 to 1950 , the Governor - General of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest ( a lion standing on the Crown ) , beneath which was the word ' India ' in gold majuscules . The same design is still used by many other Commonwealth Realm Governors - General . This last flag was the personal flag of the Governor - General only .   Residence ( edit )  Government House served as the Governor - General 's residence during most of the nineteenth century .  The Governor - General of Fort William resided in Belvedere House , Calcutta , until the early nineteenth century , when Government House was constructed . In 1854 , the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal took up residence there . Now , the Belvedere Estate houses the National Library of India .   Lord Wellesley , who is reputed to have said that ' India should be governed from a palace , not from a country house ' , constructed a grand mansion , known as Government House , between 1799 and 1803 . The mansion remained in use until the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912 . Thereafter , the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal , who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House , was upgraded to a full Governor and transferred to Government House . Now , it serves as the residence of the Governor of the Indian state of West Bengal , and is referred to by its Bengali name Raj Bhavan .   After the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi , the Viceroy occupied the newly built Viceroy 's House , designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens .""]","['India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but Governors-General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written.

what happens to the rbc in acute hemolytic reaction,"[""The former results in a severe intravascular hemolysis and the latter typically causes extravascular hemolysis . The reactions are mediated by cytokines like TNF , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein , IL - 1 etc .

Prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of renal failure may include low - dose dopamine , vigorous hydration with intravenous crystalloid solutions ( e.g. , lactated Ringer 's solution or normal saline ) , and osmotic diuresis with mannitol .   If DIC is documented and bleeding requires treatment , transfusions of frozen plasma , pooled cryoprecipitates for fibrinogen , and / or platelet concentrates may be indicated .     In case of non-antibody mediated AHR   This does not require rigorous management .   Diuresis induced by an infusion of normal saline until the intense red color of hemoglobinuria ceases is usually adequate treatment .

where did the first african american air force unit train,"[""Army flight surgeons had been black .   Training of African - American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943 , when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field , Texas . This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army . Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941 - 49 . At that time , the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years . Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa , Sicily , and Italy . The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Dr. Vance H. Marchbanks , Jr. , MD , a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis .   The accumulation of washed - out cadets at Tuskegee and the propensity of other commands to `` dump '' African - American personnel on the post exacerbated the difficulties of administering Tuskegee . A shortage of jobs for them made these enlisted men a drag on Tuskegee 's housing and culinary departments .   Trained officers were also left idle , as the plan to shift African - American officers into command slots stalled , and white officers not only continued to hold command , but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post . One rationale behind the non-assignment of trained African - American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces , General Henry `` Hap '' Arnold : `` Negro pilots can not be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation . ''   Combat assignment ( edit )  Eight Tuskegee Airmen in front of a P - 40 fighter aircraft  The 99th was finally considered ready for combat duty by April 1943 . It shipped out of Tuskegee on 2 April , bound for North Africa , where it would join the 33rd Fighter Group and its commander , Colonel William W. Momyer . Given little guidance from battle - experienced pilots , the 99th 's first combat mission was to attack the small strategic volcanic island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea lanes for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 . The air assault on the island began 30 May 1943 ."", "". It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic .   Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B - 25 Mitchell bombers , they never served in combat . The 99th Pursuit Squadron ( later , 99th Fighter Squadron ) was the first black flying squadron , and the first to deploy overseas ( to North Africa in April 1943 , and later to Sicily and Italy ) . The 332nd Fighter Group , which originally included the 100th , 301st , and 302nd Fighter Squadrons , was the first black flying group . It deployed to Italy in early 1944 . In June 1944 , the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions , and in July 1944 , with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron , it had four fighter squadrons .   The 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with Curtiss P - 40 Warhawk fighter - bomber aircraft . The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th , 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P - 39 Airacobras ( March 1944 ) , later with Republic P - 47 Thunderbolts ( June -- July 1944 ) , and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated , the North American P - 51 Mustang ( July 1944 ) . When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P - 47s red , the nickname `` Red Tails '' was coined . The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P - 51s as well as a red rudder ; the P - 51B and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes , with red propeller spinners , yellow wing bands and all - red tail surfaces .   The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African - American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces . During World War II , black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws and the American military was racially segregated , as was much of the federal government . The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to discrimination , both within and outside the army ."", ""African - American contractor McKissack and McKissack , Inc. was in charge of the contract . The company 's 2,000 workmen , the Alabama Works Progress Administration , and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months . The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057 . The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis , Jr. , one of only two black line officers then serving .   During training , Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison . Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee . However , he was transferred on 12 January 1942 , reputedly because of his insistence that his African - American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local Caucasian civilians .   His successor , Colonel Frederick von Kimble , then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield . Contrary to new Army regulations , Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama , a policy that was resented by the airmen . Later that year , the Air Corps replaced Kimble . His replacement had been the director of instruction at Tuskegee Army Airfield , Major Noel F. Parrish . Counter to the prevalent racism of the day , Parrish was fair and open - minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat .  Instrument certificate for Tuskegee Airman Robert M. Glass , signed by Parrish  The strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations . Typical of the process was the development of separate African - American flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen . Before the development of this unit , no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black .

However , these `` seasons '' only correspond to story arcs ( which are themselves split at debatable points ) , and not to the pattern in which the show actually aired in either Japan or the United States .   In Japan , Dragon Ball Z ( like both of the other Dragon Ball series ) was aired year - round continuously , with regular off - days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average .   Only when the series was broadcast in the United States was the series split into the standard seasonal cycle of new episodes followed by repeats followed by new episodes . The series was broadcast in eight separate near - continuous blocks ( 1 - 35 , 36 - 67 , 68 - 107 , 108 - 116 , 117 - 194 , 195 - 237 , 238 - 276 , and 277 - 291 ) , with breaks varying between four months to over a year between each block . In only one instance ( between episodes 194 and 195 ) was there actually parity between the DVD release and the actual broadcast sequence in terms of the end of one `` season '' and the beginning of the next .

Dick Wolf , along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center . The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists . For the female lead , Detective Olivia Benson , actresses Samantha Mathis , Reiko Aylesworth , and Mariska Hargitay were being considered . For the male role , Detective Elliot Stabler , the finalists were Tim Matheson , John Slattery , Nick Chinlund , and Christopher Meloni . Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and , after the actors left , there was a moment of dead silence , after which Wolf blurted out , `` Oh well . There 's no doubt who we should choose -- Hargitay and Meloni . '' Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together , and they ended up being his first choice . Garth Ancier , then head of NBC Entertainment , agreed , and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent .   The first actor to be cast for the show was Dann Florek . Florek had originated the character of Captain Don Cragen in the 1988 pilot for Law & Order and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives , who wanted to add female characters to the all male primary cast . He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf , however , and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show . Shortly after Florek reprised his role for Exiled : A Law & Order Movie , he received a call to be on Sex Crimes . Initially reluctant , he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role .   Shortly after the cancellation of Homicide : Life on the Street , Richard Belzer heard that Benjamin Bratt had left Law & Order ."", 'Title: Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\nLaw & Order : Special Victims Unit - Wikipedia  Law & Order : Special Victims Unit  Jump to : navigation , search For the current season , see Law & Order : Special Victims Unit ( season 19 ) .

who designed the garden city of new earswick,"[""There was housing for both workers and managers , in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees . It was founded by the York philanthropist , Joseph Rowntree , who was quoted as saying , `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin , after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .   The village had contemporaries such as Bournville , Saltaire , Port Sunlight and others . This was in sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century , the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree 's report of 1901 , entitled Poverty : a study of town life . It revealed appalling statistics of dark , overcrowded and insanitary housing .   As a result of the report , Joseph Rowntree 's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick , two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York . The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new ' garden ' village and the detailed designs for its first houses . They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City .   The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low , but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested . Houses were open to any working people , not just Rowntree employees . The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick ."", ""The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick . From 1950 the brickyard , which closed down in the 1930s , was developed into a nature reserve .   Due to their religious beliefs , The Rowntree family decreed there would not be a public house in the village . There never has been , although the Sports Club obtained a drink 's license in the 1980s .   Governance ( edit )   New Earswick is part of the Huntington & New Earswick Ward of the City of York Council . As of 2010 it is represented by Keith Hyman , Keith Orrel and Carol Runciman who are all members of the local Liberal Democrat Party .   A Parish Council was created in 1934 consisting of ten elected councillors and a clerk .   Community ( edit )   There is a local community centre , the Folk Hall , which hosts activities such as keep - fit , yoga , snooker , and a junior youth club . New Earswick has recreational facilities , including a swimming pool ( due for closure without public consultation ) , tennis courts and football , rugby and cricket pitches at the New Earswick Sports and Social Club . There were two open access play areas close to the Folk Hall , including a hard surface play area which have recently been bulldozed for a development of houses . There is a library based in the Integrated Children 's Centre at the local primary school , a doctor 's surgery and a range of shops , including two general stores , a pet shop and Post Office . As of 2017 the Post Office is situated within the Folk Hall .   The village has 36 allotments in two areas , Willow Bank and Sleeper Path .   In the 1960s , the Folk Hall was a live music venue featuring the likes of Procol Harum and Pink Floyd .   Geography ( edit )   The River Foss runs along the eastern boundary of New Earswick with the York to Scarborough Line running to the west ."", ""Archived from the original on 16 January 2008 .

what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"[""4 Location       5 Evolutionary baggage   6 Footnotes   7 See also   8 References   9 Further reading   10 External links      History of research ( edit )  The human eye , showing the iris  In 1802 , philosopher William Paley called it a miracle of `` design '' . Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species , that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance `` absurd in the highest possible degree '' . However , he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it , its evolution was perfectly feasible :   ... if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist , each grade being useful to its possessor , as is certainly the case ; if further , the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited , as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory .   He suggested a stepwise evolution from `` an optic nerve merely coated with pigment , and without any other mechanism '' to `` a moderately high stage of perfection '' , and gave examples of existing intermediate steps . Darwin 's suggestions were soon shown to be correct , and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution .   Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors . Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates . Another researcher , G.C. Young , has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions , based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through . All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin 's theory .   Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' ."", ""Title: Evolution of the eye\nEvolution of the eye - wikipedia  Evolution of the eye  Jump to : navigation , search Major stages in the evolution of the eye in vertebrates .  The evolution of the eye is attractive to study , because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms . Complex , image - forming eyes have evolved independently several times . The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion . According his theory , the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells ( so called Pax 6 genes ) appeared probably at once in the life history , at a very early stage of the evolution . Probably , the complex , image forming kinds of eyes are at least five : Chidaria - lens eye , complex eye ; Molluscs - lens eye , everse retina ; Annelids - lens eye , everse retina ; Arthropods - facet eye ; Vertebrate - lens eye , inverse retina   Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion . From before the Cambrian , no evidence of eyes has survived , but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian , and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale . Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners . They vary in their visual acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light , their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colours .

Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' . One of the many hypotheses for `` causes '' of the Cambrian explosion is the `` Light Switch '' theory of Andrew Parker : It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution . Before the Cambrian explosion , animals may have sensed light , but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision .   The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate , because the fossil record , particularly of the lower Cambrian , is poor . How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation , relative advantage to the organism , and natural selection . However , the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year , which is common in small animals . Even with these pessimistic values , the vertebrate eye would still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years .   One origin or many ? ( edit )   Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye . All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development . This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light - sensitive machinery -- even if it was not a dedicated optical organ . However , even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells . Probably , photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion . Higher - level similarities -- such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses -- reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye .   A shared trait common to all light - sensitive organs are opsins . Opsins belong to a family of photo - sensitive proteins and fall into nine groups , which already existed in the urbilaterian , the last common ancestor of all bilateral symmetrical animals .""]","['The earliest predecessors of the eye were photoreceptor proteins that sense light, found even in unicellular organisms, called ""eyespots"".

In humans , the pear - shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver , although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species . It receives and stores bile , produced by the liver , via the common hepatic duct , and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum , where the bile helps in the digestion of fats .   The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones , formed by material that can not be dissolved -- usually cholesterol or bilirubin , a product of haemoglobin breakdown . These may cause significant pain , particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen , and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy . Cholecystitis , inflammation of the gallbladder , has a wide range of causes , including result from the impaction of gallstones , infection , and autoimmune disease .', 'The outer layer of the fundus of gallbladder , and the surfaces not in contact with the liver , are covered by a thick serosa , which is exposed to the peritoneum . The serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics . The surfaces in contact with the liver are covered in connective tissue .   Variation ( edit )   The gallbladder varies in size , shape , and position between different people . Rarely , two or even three gallbladders may coexist , either as separate bladders draining into the cystic duct , or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic duct . Additionally , the gallbladder may fail to form at all . Gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist . These abnormalities are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic .   The location of the gallbladder in relation to the liver may also vary , with documented variants including gallbladders found within , above , on the left side of , behind , and detached or suspended from the liver . Such variants are very rare : from 1886 to 1998 , only 110 cases of left - lying liver , or less than one per year , were reported in scientific literature .   An anatomical variation can occur , known as a Phrygian cap , which is an innocuous fold in the fundus , named after its resemblance to the Phrygian cap .   Development ( edit )   The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube . Early in development , the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac . During the second week of embryogenesis , as the embryo grows , it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac . The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract . Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus , stomach , and intestines .   During the fourth week of embryological development , the stomach rotates . The stomach , originally lying in the midline of the embryo , rotates so that its body is on the left . This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach , which will go on to become the duodenum .', ""These may cause significant pain , particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen , and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy .

The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres ( 1.8 imperial fluid ounces ) .   The gallbladder is shaped like a pear , with its tip opening into the cystic duct . The gallbladder is divided into three sections : the fundus , body , and neck . The fundus is the rounded base , angled so that it faces the abdominal wall . The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver . The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct , part of the biliary tree . The gallbladder fossa , against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie , is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V .

An earlier African Footballer of the Year Golden Ball award was given out between 1970 and 1994 by France Football magazine . The changes resulted in parallel Golden Ball awards given out to Abedi Pele and George Weah in 1993 and 1994 by the magazine although the CAF sponsored awards for those years were won respectively by Rashidi Yekini and Emmanuel Amuneke , as well as two awards given to Abedi Pelé in 1992 .

what is the main mineral in lithium batteries,"[""The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide . Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha .   Regulation ( edit )   Some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries , which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers . Lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method , which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia .   Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation ( particularly aircraft ) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short - circuited , leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway . Most consumer lithium batteries have built - in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident , or are otherwise designed to limit short - circuit currents . Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway .

The reserve base includes those resources that are currently economic ( reserves ) , marginally economic ( marginal reserves ) , and some of those that are currently subeconomic ( subeconomic resources ) .

Estimates for the Earth 's crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight . In keeping with its name , lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks , with the largest concentrations in granites . Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium - containing minerals , with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources . Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite . A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay , the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States . At 20 mg lithium per kg of Earth 's crust , lithium is the 25th most abundant element .   According to the Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium , `` Lithium is a comparatively rare element , although it is found in many rocks and some brines , but always in very low concentrations . There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value . Many are very small , others are too low in grade . ''   The US Geological Survey estimates that in 2010 , Chile had the largest reserves by far ( 7.5 million tonnes ) and the highest annual production ( 8,800 tonnes ) . One of the largest reserve bases of lithium is in the Salar de Uyuni area of Bolivia , which has 5.4 million tonnes . Other major suppliers include Australia , Argentina and China . As of 2015 Czech Geological Survey considered the entire Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic as lithium province . Five deposits are registered , one near Cínovec ( cs ) is considered as potentially economic deposit with 160 000 tonnes of lithium .   In June 2010 , The New York Times reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there ."", ""Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall - Héroult process . These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s . After the end of the nuclear arms race , the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices . In the mid 1990s , several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open - pit mining . Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price . For example , the US mines near Kings Mountain , North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century .   The development of lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007 . With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s , new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand .

The lithium - rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds ( visible in the left image ) . World production trend of lithium  Lithium production has greatly increased since the end of World War II . The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals . The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55 % lithium chloride and 45 % potassium chloride at about 450 ° C .   As of 2015 , most of the world 's lithium production is in South America , where lithium - containing brine is extracted from underground pools and concentrated by solar evaporation . The standard extraction technique is to evaporate water from brine . Each batch takes from 18 to 24 months .   In 1998 , the price of lithium was about 95 USD / kg ( or 43 USD / lb ) .

Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, should not be confused with lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.[104][105] Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.', 'Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries.

The Forty - Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights A new provision , Article 300 - A , was added to the constitution , which provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law '' . Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property , there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation . The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32 . Thus , the right to property is no longer a fundamental right , though it is still a constitutional right . If the government appears to have acted unfairly , the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens .   The liberalisation of the economy and the government 's initiative to set up special economic zones has led to many protests by farmers and have led to calls for the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property . The Supreme Court has sent a notice to the government questioning why the right should not be brought back but in 2010 the court rejected the PIL   Right to education ( edit )   The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the fundamental rights in 2002 under the Eighty - Sixth Amendment of 2002 . However this right was brought in to implementation after eight years in 2010 . Article 21A -- On 2 April 2010 , India joined a group of few countries in the world , with a historic law making education a fundamental right of every child coming into force . Making elementary education an entitlement for children in the 6 -- 14 age group , the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act will directly benefit children who do not go to school at present . This act provides for appointment of teachers with the requisite entry and academic qualifications .   The former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh announced the operationalisation of the Act ."", ""Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws , subject to discretion of the judiciary . The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality . These rights universally apply to all citizens , irrespective of race , place of birth , religion , caste or gender . Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid and their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process . However , in case of fundamental rights violation , Supreme court of India can be approached directly for ultimate justice per Article 32 . The Rights have their origins in many sources , including England 's Bill of Rights , the United States Bill of Rights and France 's Declaration of the Rights of Man .   The six fundamental rights recognised by the Indian constitution are the right to equality , right to freedom , right against exploitation , right to freedom of religion , cultural and educational rights , right to constitutional remedies and right to privacy . The right to equality includes equality before law , prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion , race , caste , gender or place of birth , and equality of opportunity in matters of employment , abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles . The right to freedom includes freedom of speech and expression , assembly , association or union or cooperatives , movement , residence , and right to practice any profession or occupation , right to life and liberty , protection in respect to conviction in offences and protection against arrest and detention in certain cases . The right against exploitation prohibits all forms of forced labour , child labour and trafficking of human beings . The right to freedom of religion includes freedom of conscience and free profession , practice , and propagation of religion , freedom to manage religious affairs , freedom from certain taxes and freedom from religious instructions in certain educational institutes . Cultural and educational rights preserve the right of any section of citizens to conserve their culture , language or script , and right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice .

what is the use of adobe flash cs3 professional,"[""In 2007 , Adobe 's first version release was Adobe Flash CS3 Professional , the ninth major version of Flash . It introduced the ActionScript 3.0 programming language , which supported modern programming practices and enabled business applications to be developed with Flash . Adobe Flex Builder ( built on Eclipse ) targeted the enterprise application development market , and was also released the same year . Flex Builder included the Flex SDK , a set of components that included charting , advanced UI , and data services ( Flex Data Services ) .   In 2008 , Adobe released the tenth version of Flash , Adobe Flash CS4 . Flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the Flash editor , adding a motion editor panel ( similar to Adobe After Effects ) , inverse kinematics ( bones ) , basic 3D object animation , object - based animation , and other text and graphics features . Flash Player 10 included an in - built 3D engine ( without GPU acceleration ) that allowed basic object transformations in 3D space ( position , rotation , scaling ) .   Also in 2008 , Adobe released the first version of Adobe Integrated Runtime ( later re-branded as Adobe AIR ) , a runtime engine that replaced Flash Player , and provided additional capabilities to the ActionScript 3.0 language to build desktop and mobile applications . With AIR , developers could access the file system ( the user 's files and folders ) , and connected devices suxh as joystick , gamepad and sensors for the first time .   In 2011 , Adobe Flash Player 11 was released , and with it the first version of Stage3D , allowing GPU - accelerated 3D rendering for Flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X . Adobe further improved 3D capabilities from 2011 to 2013 , adding support for 3D rendering on Android and iOS platforms , alpha - channels , compressed textures , texture atlases , and other features . Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64 - bit computers , and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using AIR Native Extensions ( ANE ) .   In 2014 , Adobe AIR reached a milestone with over 100,000 unique applications built , and over 1 billion installations logged across the world ( May 2014 ) ."", 'Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64 - bit computers , and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using AIR Native Extensions ( ANE ) .   In 2014 , Adobe AIR reached a milestone with over 100,000 unique applications built , and over 1 billion installations logged across the world ( May 2014 ) . Adobe AIR was voted the Best Mobile Application Development product at the Consumer Electronics Show on two consecutive years ( CES 2014 and CES 2015 ) . In 2016 , Adobe renamed Flash Professional , the primary authoring software for Flash content , to Adobe Animate to reflect its growing use for authoring HTML5 content in favour of Flash content .   Open Screen Project ( edit )   On May 1 , 2008 , Adobe announced the Open Screen Project , with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers , mobile devices , and consumer electronics . When the project was announced , seven goals were outlined : the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime , the removal of restrictions on the use of the Shockwave Flash ( SWF ) and Flash Video ( FLV ) file formats , the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices , and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format ( AMF ) , which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases .   As of February 2009 , the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV / F4V specs have been published . The Flash Cast protocol -- now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol -- and AMF protocols have also been made available , with AMF available as an open source implementation , BlazeDS .   The list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes Palm , Motorola , and Nokia , who , together with Adobe , have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund . As of 2012 , the Open Screen Project is no longer accepting new applications according to partner BSQuare . However paid licensing is still an option for device makers who want to use Adobe software .   End of life ( edit )   Although Flash was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content , it is slowly being abandoned as Adobe favors a transition to HTML5 due to inherent security flaws and significant resources required to maintain the platform .', 'Adobe Flash Lite enabled viewing Flash content on older smartphones , but has been discontinued and superseded by Adobe AIR .   The ActionScript programming language allows the development of interactive animations , video games , web applications , desktop applications and mobile applications . Programmers can implement Flash software using an IDE such as Adobe Animate , Adobe Flash Builder , Adobe Director , FlashDevelop and Powerflasher FDT . Adobe AIR enables full - featured desktop and mobile applications to be developed with Flash and published for Windows , macOS , Android , iOS , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , and Nintendo Wii U and Switch .   Although Flash was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content , it is slowly being abandoned as Adobe favors a transition to HTML5 . Flash Player has been deprecated and has an official end - of - life by 2020 . However , Adobe will continue to develop Adobe AIR , a technology for building applications and games with Flash .

where do they grow hops in the us,"[""Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York 's production by the 1920s , and California only produces hops on a small scale .   Hop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles .   World production ( edit )   Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates , with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north . Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however , not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada , for example , lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically , hops were not grown in Ireland , but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone .   Important production centres today are the Hallertau in Germany ( more hop - growing area than any other country as of 2006 ) , the Yakima ( Washington ) and Willamette ( Oregon ) valleys , and western Canyon County , Idaho ( including the communities of Parma , Wilder , Greenleaf , and Notus ) . The principal production centres in the UK are in Kent ( which produces Kent Goldings hops ) , Herefordshire , and Worcestershire . Essentially all of the harvested hops are used in beer making .  Early season hop growth in a hop yard in the Yakima River Valley of Washington with Mount Adams in the distance    Hop producing country   2012 hop output in tonnes ( t )     Germany   34,434     United States   27,782     China   11,000     Czech Republic   4,338     Poland   2,206     North Korea   2,000     Albania   1,650     United Kingdom   1,650     Slovenia   1,338     Cultivation and harvest ( edit )  A superstructure of overhead wires supports strings that in turn support bines  Although hops are grown in most of the continental United States and Canada , cultivation of hops for commercial production requires a particular environment . As hops are a climbing plant , they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile ."", ""In 1471 , Norwich , England , banned use of the plant in the brewing of ale ( `` beer '' was the name for fermented malt liquors bittered with hops ; only in recent times are the words often used as synonyms ) .   In Germany , using hops was also a religious and political choice in the early 16th century . There was no tax on hops to be paid on the Catholic church , unlike on gruit , for which the Protestant preferred hopped beer .   Hops used in England were imported from France , Holland and Germany with import duty paid for those ; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England ( Kent ) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers . Therefore , in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words ( see oast house ) . Hops were then grown as far north as Aberdeen , near breweries for infrastructure convenience .   According to Thomas Tusser 's 1557 Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry :   `` The hop for his profit I thus do exalt , It strengtheneth drink and it flavoureth malt ; And being well - brewed long kept it will last , And drawing abide , if ye draw not too fast . ''   In England there were many complaints over the quality of imported hops , the sacks of which were often contaminated by stalks , sand or straw to increase their weight . As a result , in 1603 , King James I approved an Act of Parliament banning the practice by which `` the Subjects of this Realm have been of late years abused &c. to the Value of £ 20,000 yearly , besides the Danger of their Healths '' .   Hop cultivation was begun in the present - day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers . Before prohibition , cultivation was mainly centred around New York , California , Oregon , and Washington state . Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York 's production by the 1920s , and California only produces hops on a small scale .   Hop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles .

what's the dog's name on tom and jerry,"[""He switches the mind of the orange cat with that of a bulldog and presents him as his present to Jerry .   Thin lady ( edit )   An unnamed thin white lady became Tom 's owner in Buddies Thicker Than Water . Gene Deitch opted not to use Mammy 's character in his shorts , as he felt a `` stereotypical black housekeep '' character `` did n't work in a modern context . '' Chuck Jones would also use her in The Unshrinkable Jerry Mouse and in the re-animated version of Saturday Evening Puss . She also appeared in the movie Tom and Jerry : The Fast and the Furry . Like many other early human characters , her face was never shown .   Chuck Jones era ( edit )   The following characters were introduced in the theatrical shorts that were produced by Chuck Jones in the 1960s .   Tiny bulldog ( edit )   This nameless mouse - sized bulldog , designed similarly to Spike the Bulldog , is Jerry 's pet dog companion in only two shorts : The Cat 's Me - Ouch and Purr - Chance to Dream . His role is similar to Spike in cartoons such as The Bodyguard , Fit To Be Tied , and Much Ado About Mousing , which is to defend Jerry against Tom . He is presumably the oldest son of Spike before Tyke , and this could be identified by his looks and personality that is similar to his father Spike . Unlike Spike and Tyke he has a big bite ( similar to those of Looney Tunes ' Tasmanian Devil ) .   Porpoise ( edit )   A shark who tries to eat Tom and Jerry . He appears in Cannery Rodent , Puss ' n ' Boats , Filet Meow and Surf - Bored Cat . The creature 's color and species varies , in Cannery Rodent and Surf - Bored Cat it is a blue shark , while in Filet Meow and Puss ' n ' Boats it is a great white shark .   Porpoise also appeared in the Tom and Jerry Comedy Show episode A Connecticut mouse in King Arthur 's court .   The Tom and Jerry Show ( edit )   The following characters were introduced in the 1975 television series The Tom and Jerry Show .   Broke ( edit )   A gopher that devours vegetables in Gopher Broke ."", ""In their first appearance in Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes , they are local gravediggers who work for Professor Moriarty . In Tom and Jerry : Robin Hood and His Merry Mouse , they work for Prince John . In Tom and Jerry : The Lost Dragon , they are the Hench - cats of Drizelda . In Tom and Jerry : Spy Quest , they are seen working for Doctor Zin . They also make an appearance in Tom and Jerry : Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory . They were named after the Warner Bros. 1943 short Tin Pan Alley Cats . Tin is voiced by Greg Ellis , Pan by Jess Harnell and Alley by Richard McGonagle .   Butch ( dog ) ( edit )  Main article : Butch Dog ( Tex Avery )  Butch ( Originally known as Spike , until renamed as Butch to avoid confusion with Spike from the Tom and Jerry cartoons ) is the name of another bulldog from Tex Avery 's shorts in the 1940s and 1950s . He was one of the main antagonists in Droopy shorts ( although he was replaced by Hanna - Barbera 's Spike in the 1980s ) and also had a series of his own . He appears in a number of movies e.g. Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz and Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring .   References ( edit )    Jump up ^ Deitch , Gene ( 2015 ) .

He is usually but not always , portrayed as living a comfortable , or even pampered life , while Jerry ( named `` Jinx '' in his debut appearance ) is a small , brown , house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom . Despite being very energetic , determined and much larger , Tom is no match for Jerry 's wits . Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size , approximately the equivalent of Tom 's , lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts . Although cats typically chase mice to consume them , it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to consume Jerry . Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry , sometimes in revenge , and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry . By the final `` fade - out '' of each cartoon , Jerry usually emerges triumphant , while Tom is shown as the loser .   However , other results may be reached . On rare occasions , Tom triumphs , usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or when he pushes Tom a little too far . In The Million Dollar Cat Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal , `` including a mouse ; '' he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates . In Timid Tabby Tom 's look - alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge . Occasionally and usually ironically , they both lose , usually when Jerry 's final trap or attack on Tom backfires or Jerry overlooks something . In Chuck Jones ' Filet Meow , Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish , but finds himself entirely intimidated as well . Finally , they occasionally end up being friends , although within this set of stories , there is often a last minute event that ruins the truce .""]","[""Spike, occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer, is a stern but occasionally dumb American bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats, but a softie when it comes to mice (though in his debut appearance, Dog Trouble, Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry), and later, his son Tyke.

in which regions are most of africa petroleum and natural gas found,"[""Nigeria is one of the few major oil - producing nations still capable of increasing its oil output . Unlike most of the other OPEC countries , Nigeria is not projected to exceed peak production until at least 2009 . The reason for Nigeria 's relative unproductivity is primarily OPEC regulations on production to regulate prices on the international market . More recently , production has been disrupted intermittently by the protests of the Niger Delta 's inhabitants , who feel they are being exploited .   Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources . The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or `` South - south '' region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields . Most of Nigeria 's oil fields are small and scattered , and as of 1990 , these small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1 % of all Nigerian production . This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9 % of Nigeria 's petroleum at that time .   As a result of the numerous small fields , an extensive and well - developed pipeline network has been engineered to transport the crude oil . Also because of the lack of highly productive fields , money from the jointly operated ( with the federal government ) companies is constantly directed towards petroleum exploration and production .   Nigeria 's petroleum is classified mostly as `` light '' and `` sweet '' , as the oil is largely free of sulphur . Nigeria is the largest producer of sweet oil in OPEC . This sweet oil is similar in composition to petroleum extracted from the North Sea . This crude oil is known as `` Bonny light '' . Names of other Nigerian crudes , all of which are named according to export terminal , are Qua Ibo , Escravos blend , Brass River , Forcados , and Pennington Anfan .   As recently as 2010 , Nigeria provided about 10 % of overall U.S. oil imports and ranked as the fifth - largest source for oil imports in the U.S. However , Nigeria ceased exports to the US in July 2014 because of the impact of shale production in America ; India is now the largest consumer of Nigerian oil .   There are six petroleum exportation terminals in the country ."", ""In 2008 , the government prepared a Gas Master Plan that was intended to promote natural gas production and encourage the supply of natural gas to domestic power stations so as to help alleviate the country 's electricity shortages . There is also an export gas pipeline , known as the West African Gas Pipeline , in the works but has encountered numerous setbacks . The pipeline would allow for transportation of natural gas to Benin , Ghana , Togo , and Cote d'Ivoire . The majority of Nigeria 's natural gas is flared off and it is estimated that Nigeria loses 18.2 million US $ daily from the loss of the flared gas .   Downstream ( edit )       This section 's factual accuracy is disputed . Relevant discussion may be found on Talk : Petroleum industry in Nigeria . Please help to ensure that disputed statements are reliably sourced . ( May 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     Nigeria 's total petroleum refining capacity is 445,000 barrels ( 70,700 m ) per day , however , only 240,000 barrels ( 38,000 m ) per day was allotted during the 1990s . Subsequently , crude oil production for refineries was reduced further to as little as 75,000 barrels ( 11,900 m ) per day during the regime of Sanni Abacha . There are four major oil refineries : the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Plant which can process 125,000 barrels ( 19,900 m ) of crude per day , the New Port Harcourt Refinery which can produce 150,000 barrels ( 24,000 m ) per day ( there is also an ' Old ' Port Harcourt Refinery with negligible production ) , as well as the now defunct Kaduna Refinery . The Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries both operate at only 30 % capacity .   It is estimated that demand and consumption of petroleum in Nigeria grows at a rate of 12.8 % annually . However , petroleum products are unavailable to most Nigerians and are quite costly , because almost all of the oil extracted by the multinational oil companies is refined overseas , while only a limited quantity is supplied to Nigerians themselves .

A new license covering 920,000 square kilometres ( 357,000 square miles ) was given to Shell D'arcy Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria , a consortium of Shell and British Petroleum ( then known as Anglo - Iranian ) .

The enormous pearl is 30 cm wide ( 1 ft ) , 67 cm long ( 2.2 ft ) and weighs 75 lb ( 34 kg ) .   History ( edit )   Pearl hunting ( edit )  Main article : Pearl hunting A 14th - century piece of clothing used by Kuwaiti divers searching for pearls in the Persian Gulf  The ancient chronicle Mahavamsa mentions of the thriving pearl industry in the port of Oruwella in the Gulf of Mannar in Sri Lanka . It also records that eight varieties of pearls accompanied Prince Vijaya 's embassy to the Pandyan king as well as king Devanampiya Tissa 's embassy to Emperor Ashoka . Pliny the Elder ( 23 -- 79AD ) praised the pearl fishery of the Gulf as most productive in the world .   For thousands of years , seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf , the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar . Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions . Starting in the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC -- 220 AD ) , the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea . In the 14th - century Arabian Sea , the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver 's waist .  Catching of pearls , Bern Physiologus ( 9th century )  When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Western Hemisphere , they discovered that around the islands of Cubagua and Margarita , some 200 km north of the Venezuelan coast , was an extensive pearl bed ( a bed of pearl oysters ) . One discovered and named pearl , La Peregrina pearl , was offered to the Spanish queen . According to Garcilasso de la Vega , who says that he saw La Peregrina at Seville in 1607 , this was found at Panama in 1560 by a slave worker who was rewarded with his liberty , and his owner with the office of alcalde of Panama .   Margarita pearls are extremely difficult to find today and are known for their unique yellowish color ."", ""Prized for their exquisitely beautiful ' orient ' or lustre , South Sea pearls are now farmed in various parts of the world where the Pinctada maxima oysters can be found , with the finest South Sea pearls being produced by Paspaley along the remote coastline of North - Western Australia . White and silver colored South Sea pearls tend to come from the Broome area of Australia , while golden colored ones are more prevalent in the Philippines and Indonesia .   A farm in the Gulf of California , Mexico , is culturing pearls from the black lipped Pinctada mazatlanica oysters and the rainbow lipped Pteria sterna oysters . Also called Concha Nácar , the pearls from these rainbow lipped oysters fluoresce red under ultraviolet light .   From other species ( edit )  A shell of the Indian volute , Melo melo , surrounded by a number of pearls from this species Conch pearl pendant  Biologically speaking , under the right set of circumstances , almost any shelled mollusk can produce some kind of pearl . However , most of these molluskan pearls have no luster or iridescence . The great majority of mollusk species produce pearls which are not attractive , and are sometimes not even very durable , such that they usually have no value at all , except perhaps to a scientist or collector , or as a curiosity . These objects used to be referred to as `` calcareous concretions '' by some gemologists , even though a malacologist would still consider them to be pearls . Valueless pearls of this type are sometimes found in edible mussels , edible oysters , escargot snails , and so on . The GIA and CIBJO now simply use the term ' pearl ' ( or , where appropriate , the more descriptive term ' non-nacreous pearl ' ) when referring to such items and , under Federal Trade Commission rules , various mollusk pearls may be referred to as ' pearls ' , without qualification .   A few species produce pearls that can be of interest as gemstones . These species include the bailer shell Melo , the giant clam Tridacna , various scallop species , Pen shells Pinna , and the Haliotis iris species of abalone .""]","[""For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.[29][30][31] Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions.[30][31] Starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea.[citation needed] In the 14th-century Arabian Sea, the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver's waist.[citation needed]""]",Pearls in India are found in the Gulf of Mannar.,the Indian Ocean,0.9999999999666668,0.0,0.0,0.0,,0.918011821364034

Kylo Ren was first seen , but still not named , in the 88 - second The Force Awakens teaser trailer released by Lucasfilm on November 28 , 2014 , wielding a jagged red lightsaber with a crossguard . The name Kylo Ren was revealed by Entertainment Weekly in a Lucasfilm - designed Topps - style trading card mockup in December 2014 . A May 2015 Vanity Fair photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz confirmed that Driver would be portraying Kylo .   In an interview with Time , The Force Awakens costume designer Michael Kaplan said that Abrams requested that Ren 's mask be designed to be memorable for a child . After numerous attempts to gain Abrams ' approval , the final design was selected . Kaplan said :   I do n't know if it was the kind of spaghetti type lines on it or what , but the next time J.J. came by that was what we presented to him and he loved it ."", ""Title: Kylo Ren\nKylo Ren - wikipedia  Kylo Ren  Jump to : navigation , search `` Kylo '' redirects here .

After arriving at Jakku to retrieve a map containing the coordinates for the location of Luke Skywalker , Ren kills an old vicar known as Lor San Tekka and captures Resistance pilot Poe Dameron , who has also been sent to recover the map by General Leia Organa . Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his astromech droid , BB - 8 , with the map . Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper Finn , who later finds BB - 8 , and the scavenger Rey . Finn , Rey , and BB - 8 escape Jakku in the Millennium Falcon , and are soon intercepted by the ship 's former owner , Han Solo , and his co-pilot Chewbacca .   It is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia , and was once one of Luke 's Jedi pupils . He was drawn to the dark side of the Force by the First Order 's Supreme Leader Snoke . He then helped to destroy his uncle Luke 's new Jedi Academy . However , Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome this weakness from his grandfather Darth Vader , whose burnt helmet is in Ren 's possession . Arriving at the Maz Kanata castle , Ren captures Rey , who he senses has seen the map . While interrogating her with the Force , he realizes that she is strong with the Force herself , though unaware of it .

how many countries are a part of opec,"[""As of May 2017 , OPEC 's members are Algeria , Angola , Ecuador , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia ( the de facto leader ) , United Arab Emirates , and Venezuela , while Indonesia is a former member . Two - thirds of OPEC 's oil production and reserves are in its six Middle Eastern countries that surround the oil - rich Persian Gulf .   The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources , and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations . The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply . In the 1970s , restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC 's revenue and wealth , with long - lasting and far - reaching consequences for the global economy . In the 1980s , OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations ; and generally when the production targets are reduced , oil prices increase , most recently from the organization 's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply .   Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition , but whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law . In December 2014 , `` OPEC and the oil men '' ranked as # 3 on Lloyd 's list of `` the top 100 most influential people in the shipping industry '' . However , their influence on international trade is periodically challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources , and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC countries to exceed production ceilings and pursue conflicting self - interests ."", ""According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , OPEC 's combined rate of oil production ( including gas condensate ) represented 44 percent of the world 's total in 2016 , and OPEC accounted for 73 percent of the world 's `` proven '' oil reserves , including 48 percent from just the six Middle Eastern members :   Approval of a new member country requires agreement by three - quarters of OPEC 's existing members , including all five of the founders .

Pulitzer Prize - winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle called the jeep , along with the Coleman G.I. Pocket Stove , `` the two most important pieces of noncombat equipment ever developed . '' Jeeps became even more famous following the war , as they became available on the surplus market . Some ads claimed to offer `` Jeeps still in the factory crate . '' This legend persisted for decades , despite the fact that Jeeps were never shipped from the factory in crates ( although Ford did `` knock down '' Jeeps for easier shipping , which may have perpetuated the myth ) .   The Jeepney is a unique type of taxi or bus created in the Philippines . The first Jeepneys were military - surplus MBs and GPWs , left behind in the war - ravaged country following World War II and Filipino independence . Jeepneys were built from Jeeps by lengthening and widening the rear `` tub '' of the vehicle , allowing them to carry more passengers .

NFL.com named Sanders # 34 on NFL 's Top 100 list released in late 2010   On November 11 , 2010 , Sanders was inducted into the Atlanta Falcons ' Ring of Honor .

On May 17 , 2011 , Sanders was announced as a College Football Hall of Fame inductee .   On August 6 , 2011 , Sanders was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame .    Sanders also had a rushing TD in the playoffs ( against the Philadelphia Eagles in January 1996 ) . This makes him ( including post season ) one of only two players in NFL history ( Bill Dudley being the other ) to score a touchdown six different ways ( interception return , punt return , kickoff return , receiving , rushing , and a fumble recovery ) .   On February 6 , 2011 , at Super Bowl XLV in Arlington , Texas , Sanders performed the pre-game coin toss .   Sanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester of his senior year at Florida State , yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn . This caused the Florida State Legislature to create the ' Deion Sanders rule ' , whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester .   In 1995 , he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL 's salary cap . This caused the NFL to institute its own ' Deion Sanders rule ' whereby a prorated portion of a player 's signing bonus counted against the salary cap .

what is the name of manchester united stadium,"[""The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later . In October 1895 , before the visit of Manchester City , the club purchased a 2,000 - capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club , and put up another stand on the `` reserved side '' ( as distinct from the `` popular side '' ) . However , weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000 .   When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902 , club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club 's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham . Following financial investment , new club president John Henry Davies paid £ 500 for the erection of a new 1,000 - seat stand at Bank Street . Within four years , the stadium had cover on all four sides , as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators , some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand .   However , following Manchester United 's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later , it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ' ambition ; in February 1909 , six weeks before the club 's first FA Cup title , Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United , following the purchase of land for around £ 60,000 . Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £ 30,000 for construction ; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000 , though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000 . The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester . The stadium 's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939 , when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators .   Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium ; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter . After the war , the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £ 22,278 . While reconstruction took place , the team played its `` home '' games at Manchester City 's Maine Road ground ; Manchester United was charged £ 5,000 per year , plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts ."", ""Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium ; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter .

While reconstruction took place , the team played its `` home '' games at Manchester City 's Maine Road ground ; Manchester United was charged £ 5,000 per year , plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts . Later improvements included the addition of roofs , first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands . The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans ' views , and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure . The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof , completed in time for the 1993 -- 94 season . First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £ 40,000 , four 180 - foot ( 55 m ) pylons were erected , each housing 54 individual floodlights . These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand , which remains in use today .   The Taylor Report 's requirement for an all - seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993 . In 1995 , the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers , restoring capacity to approximately 55,000 . At the end of the 1998 -- 99 season , second tiers were added to the East and West Stands , raising capacity to around 67,000 , and between July 2005 and May 2006 , 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north - west and north - east quadrants . Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006 , when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record . The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007 , when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4 -- 1 , with just 114 seats ( 0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212 ) unoccupied ."", ""United of Manchester .

The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port . Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and , at many points in their history , they have battled each other for the league title ( most recently in the 2008 -- 09 season ) . Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season .   The `` Roses Rivalry '' with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses , fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York , with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire .   The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams , as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger , have battled for the Premier League title . With 33 titles between them ( 20 for Manchester United , 13 for Arsenal ) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match - ups in history .   Global brand  Aeroflot is an official carrier of the club .  Manchester United has been described as a global brand ; a 2011 report by Brand Finance , valued the club 's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £ 412 million -- an increase of £ 39 million on the previous year , valuing it at £ 11 million more than the second best brand , Real Madrid -- and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA ( Extremely Strong ) .

Williams Jr. and the all - star band returned , only this time they played in a `` juke joint '' set on a country road . The lead singer arrives in a GMC Yukon truck ( GMC paid for product placement ) with the license plate `` BOCEPHUS '' , which is Williams ' nickname . The Syndicate 's computer - generated tease was dropped and replaced by short pre-taped films focusing on a team or player in the game . Some of them have featured actor Jamie Foxx .   The guest visits continued : Barkley returned to the booth on September 17 in Philadelphia . Other guests throughout the season included Kimmel ( another returnee ) , Drew Carey , Miley Cyrus , Russell Crowe and Terry Bradshaw . In addition , Gordon was a halftime guest on the game just before the season - ending Ford 400 and was joined by teammate Jimmie Johnson .   At the end of each game , Williams returned to say , `` See you in ( city that is the site of the next week 's game ) . '' Both the open and close contain helmets of the participating teams , organized in the style of a concert poster .  2008 summary ( edit )  Despite the de-emphasis on entertainment on the overall telecast , ESPN did bring back Hank Williams , Jr. for his 20th season as part of the opening . This time , the opening sequence was set in a private residence . At the end of the song , Williams Jr. touched a foot pump , which supposedly contained the helmets of that night 's participating teams . The helmets were launched from the home toward the stadium at which the game was held . Through computer - generated imagery , the helmets `` land '' at midfield during a live shot , and then explode . The `` exploding helmets '' gimmick was also used at various times in the 1980s and 1990s during the pre-game tease . Williams Jr. then appeared again at the end of the game to promote the next week 's matchup .   ESPN also continued to promote upcoming albums through its use in bumper music ."", ""The 2006 telecast generally began with a cinematic tease produced by Rico Labbe , Michael Sciallis and Jason Jobes . It was during one of these teases that Barack Obama spoofed his announcement for the 2008 Presidential candidacy in favor of his hometown Chicago Bears in their game against the St. Louis Rams .   That year , the tease was followed by the show open produced by Los Angeles - based The Syndicate called `` Transformation '' . It features computer - generated imagery showing a city being transformed into a football stadium and passers - by on the street turning into players , coaches , fans and officials set to an updated orchestral treatment of the `` Heavy Action '' theme song . The sequence began every week with a different celebrity walking down the street , picking up a glowing football helmet with the ESPN logo on the side and saying , `` I 'm ready for some football ! Are you ? '' , thus beginning the transformation process . Celebrities for 2006 included Arnold Schwarzenegger , Matthew Fox , Hugh Hefner , Paris Hilton , Spike Lee , Ashton Kutcher , Samuel L. Jackson , Ludacris , Jack Black , Kiefer Sutherland , James Belushi , Ben Stiller , Tyra Banks , Carmen Electra and Eva Longoria .   In addition , celebrities returned in full force to the booth , though this proved to be the major criticism of ESPN 's first MNF season . On the opening weekend , Arnold Schwarzenegger , another celebrity - turned - California governor , was in the booth at McAfee Coliseum in Oakland , California ; before that , Jamie Foxx appeared at FedExField in suburban Washington , D.C. Following them , celebrity appearances included NBA basketball superstar Dwyane Wade , Basketball Hall of Fame player Charles Barkley , NASCAR Cup Series driver Jeff Gordon , comedian Jimmy Kimmel ( whose opening words to Joe Theismann were `` how 's the leg ?

who wrote cant get you out of my head lyrics,"[""Jointly written , composed , and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' is a midtempo dance - pop song which lyrically details its narrator 's obsession towards her lover . The song is famous for its `` la la la '' hook .   In addition to positive reviews from music critics , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' found commercial success on a large scale . It peaked at number one on the charts of Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Poland , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , and every other European country excluding Finland . It also topped the charts of Minogue 's native country Australia , Canada and New Zealand . In the United States , the song peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , becoming Minogue 's biggest hit in the region since `` The Loco - Motion '' . `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' reportedly reached number one in 40 countries across the globe . It was certified triple - platinum in Australia , double - platinum in the United Kingdom , and gold in the United States . It became Minogue 's first single to sell in excess of one million copies in the United Kingdom , where it also stands as the 28th best - selling single of the millennium . As of 2013 , the song was Minogue 's highest selling single and one of the best - selling singles of all time , with worldwide sales exceeding five million .   The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Dawn Shadforth , and featured Minogue performing various dance routines in different futuristic backdrops . It became notable for the revealing hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore during one of the scenes . The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours as of 2017 , with the exception of the Anti Tour . Following its release , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' ranked on a number of decade - end lists compiled by magazines such as Rolling Stone , The Guardian , and NME . It is considered to be Minogue 's strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States and is said to have been the reason behind the success of its parent album Fever in the region ."", ""She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour . Minogue premiered `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' by performing it during the tour , and soon after , discussion regarding the song `` quickly set online messageboards alight . '' `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was chosen as the lead single from Minogue 's eighth studio album , Fever , and it was released on 8 September 2001 by Parlophone in Australia , while in the United Kingdom and other European countries it was released on 17 September .  My A&R at the time , Miles Leonard and Jamie Nelson , said , `` We 've got something . Come into the office . We 've got to play you something . '' So I went to the EMI office , and I had the same reaction you did , about 20 seconds in . I could n't even fathom what I was hearing . It just ... did something . I was beside myself . Then at the end of the song , panic set in . I was saying `` Are you sure we 've got this song ? Do n't tell me that we do n't ! Is it secured ? Can we have it ? '' And we did ! And that kick - started a whole different phase in my career .  -- Minogue , about her reaction to hearing the demo of the song .   `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was jointly written , composed , and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis . Dennis and Davis had been brought together by British artist manager Simon Fuller , who wanted the duo to come up with a song for British pop group S Club 7 . The song was recorded using Cubase music software , which Davis ran on his Mac computer . Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop , on which Dennis , herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States , began singing the line `` I just ca n't get you out of my head '' in the key of D minor . After three and a half hours , the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards . Dennis called their recording setup for the song `` the most primitive set - up you could imagine ! Different producers work in different ways ."", ""'' Similarly , Everett True from The Guardian wrote that the song continued the `` change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie '' and her transition from the `` homely girl - next - door '' to `` a much more flirtatious , sophisticated persona '' that started with the release of `` Spinning Around '' in 2000 . True also felt that the success of `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was one of the motivating factors behind `` manufactured '' pop music gaining a `` new postmodern respectability '' and marked a `` clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the ' serious ' rock critic fraternity : the idea that ( manufactured , female ) pop music might well be the equal of ( organic , male ) rock music after all , that each has their high points and their low . '' In 2011 , Minogue 's official website posted a special article marking the song 's 10th anniversary on 8 September , the release date of `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' in Australia . `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' is recognised as Minogue 's signature song .   `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' garnered Minogue a number of awards . At the 2001 Top of the Pops Awards ceremony , the song won the award for `` Best Single . '' At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards ceremony , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' won the awards for `` Single of the Year '' and `` Highest Selling Single , '' and Minogue won the `` Outstanding Achievement Award . '' In 2002 , it won a Dutch Edison Award for `` Single of the Year . '' In the same year , Dennis and Davis won three awards at the 47th Ivor Novello Awards for their composition of the song ; they won the awards `` The Ivors Dance Award , '' `` Most Performed Work , '' and `` International Hit of the Year . '' At the inaugural Premios Oye ! in 2002 , the song received a nomination in the category of `` Song of the Year . '' In the 2007 episode of The Simpsons , `` Homerazzi '' , the track is heard playing in a celebrity - packed nightclub into which Homer storms . The track is also heard in the films Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason , Hey Good Looking !""]","['""Can\'t Get You Out of My Head"" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eighth studio album, titled Fever, which she released in 2001.

who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"[""He is dethroned by the spectre of an actor , and we shall never be able to keep the usurper out of our dreams .  Maurice Maeterlinck in La Jeune Belgique ( 1890 ) .   Shakespeare 's day to the Interregnum ( edit )   Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage . He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range . Judging by the number of reprints , Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare 's fourth most popular play during his lifetime -- only Henry IV Part 1 , Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it . Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set ; however , as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets , this would not have affected the staging .   Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant . What is known is that the crew of the ship Red Dragon , anchored off Sierra Leone , performed Hamlet in September 1607 ; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare 's death ; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637 . Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that , since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet ( only Falstaff is mentioned more , from Shakespeare ) , the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses .   All theatres were closed down by the Puritan government during the Interregnum . Even during this time , however , playlets known as drolls were often performed illegally , including one called The Grave - Makers based on Act 5 , Scene 1 of Hamlet .   Restoration and 18th century ( edit )  Title page and frontispiece for Hamlet , Prince of Denmark : A Tragedy . As it is now acted at the Theatres - Royal in Drury - Lane and Covent - Garden . London , 1776  The play was revived early in the Restoration . When the existing stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies , Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant 's Duke 's Company secured ."", ""In 1748 , Alexander Sumarokov wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius 's tyranny -- a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century . In the years following America 's independence , Thomas Apthorpe Cooper , the young nation 's leading tragedian , performed Hamlet among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia , and at the Park Theatre in New York . Although chided for `` acknowledging acquaintances in the audience '' and `` inadequate memorisation of his lines '' , he became a national celebrity .   19th century ( edit )  A poster , ca . 1884 , for an American production of Hamlet ( starring Thomas W. Keene ) , showing several of the key scenes  From around 1810 to 1840 , the best - known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors -- including George Frederick Cooke , Junius Brutus Booth , Edmund Kean , William Charles Macready , and Charles Kemble . Of these , Booth remained to make his career in the States , fathering the nation 's most notorious actor , John Wilkes Booth ( who later assassinated Abraham Lincoln ) , and its most famous Hamlet , Edwin Booth . Edwin Booth 's Hamlet at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in 1875 was described as `` ... the dark , sad , dreamy , mysterious hero of a poem. ... ( acted ) in an ideal manner , as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life '' . Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864 / 5 season at The Winter Garden Theatre , inaugurating the era of long - run Shakespeare in America .   In the United Kingdom , the actor - managers of the Victorian era ( including Kean , Samuel Phelps , Macready , and Henry Irving ) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner , with elaborate scenery and costumes . The tendency of actor - managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics ' approval . George Bernard Shaw 's praise for Johnston Forbes - Robertson 's performance contains a sideswipe at Irving : `` The story of the play was perfectly intelligible , and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments .

Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) . Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others . The play 's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny . One such example is the centuries - old debate about Hamlet 's hesitation to kill his uncle , which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action , but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold - blooded murder , calculated revenge , and thwarted desire . More recently , psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet 's unconscious desires , while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude .""]","[""The story of Shakespeare's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest.

where does the story the great gatsby take place,"[""Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby 's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald 's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby 's fortune . Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book 's plotline within the historical context of the era .   Fitzgerald 's visits to Long Island 's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby 's setting . Today , there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book . One possibility is Land 's End , a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party . Many of the events in Fitzgerald 's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota , and like Nick , he was educated at an Ivy League school , Princeton ( in Nick 's case , Yale ) . Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby , in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved . Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant , and was stationed at Camp Sheridan , in Montgomery , Alabama . There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen - year - old beauty named Zelda Sayre . Zelda finally agreed to marry him , but her preference for wealth , fun , and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success . Like Nick in The Great Gatsby , Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting , and , like Gatsby , he had always idolized the very rich . In many ways , The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald 's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age . Like Gatsby , Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted , even as she led him toward everything he despised .   In her book Careless People : Murder , Mayhem and the Invention of ' The Great Gatsby ( 2013 ) , Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall - Mills Case ."", ""Title: The Great Gatsby\nThe Great Gatsby - Wikipedia  The Great Gatsby  Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the novel .

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval , and excess , creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream .   Fitzgerald -- inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's north shore -- began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , `` something new -- something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . '' Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue .   First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly ; in its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies ."", ""The play failed miserably , and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production . The stories were , in his words , `` all trash and it nearly broke my heart , '' although included among those stories was `` Winter Dreams '' , which Fitzgerald later described as `` a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea '' .   After the birth of their child , the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck , New York , on Long Island , in October 1922 . The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald 's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner , actor Lew Fields , and comedian Ed Wynn . These figures were all considered to be `` new money '' , unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula , places which were home to many of New York 's wealthiest established families , and which sat across the bay from Great Neck . This real - life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for `` West Egg '' and `` East Egg '' . In this novel , Great Neck ( King 's Point ) became the `` new money '' peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington ( Sands Point ) the old - money East Egg . Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby 's home , such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers , since demolished .   By mid-1923 , Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel but discarded most of his new story as a false start , some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story `` Absolution '' .   Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924 . Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger , `` Out of woods at last and starting novel . '' He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a `` consciously artistic achievement '' and a `` purely creative work -- not trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world . '' He added later , during editing , that he felt `` an enormous power in me now , more than I 've ever had . '' Soon after this burst of inspiration , work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera , where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed .""]","[""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.
