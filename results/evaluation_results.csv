other crystal structures.\n Also known are CdCl•HO and CdCl•5HO.', 'Title: Gold(III) chloride\nGold(III) chloride, traditionally called auric chloride, is a chemical compound of gold and chlorine.\n With the molecular formula AuCl, the name gold trichloride is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl.\n The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds.\n There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl).\n Chloroauric acid, HAuCl, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is sometimes referred to as ""gold chloride"" or ""acid gold trichloride"".\n Gold(III) chloride is very hygroscopic and highly soluble in water as well as ethanol.\n It decomposes above 160\xa0°C or in light.', 'Title: Water blue\nWater blue, also known as aniline blue, Acid blue 22, Soluble Blue 3M, Marine Blue V, or C.I. 42755, is a chemical compound used as a stain in histology.\n Water blue stains collagen blue in tissue sections.\n It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol.', 'Title: Chloride\nThe chloride ion is the anion (negatively charged ion) Cl.\n It is formed when the element chlorine (a halogen) gains an electron or when a compound such as hydrogen chloride is dissolved in water or other polar solvents.\n Chloride salts such as sodium chloride are often very soluble in water.\n It is an essential electrolyte located in all body fluids responsible for maintaining acid/base balance, transmitting nerve impulses and regulating fluid in and out of cells.\n Less frequently, the word ""chloride"" may also form part of the ""common"" name of chemical compounds in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded.\n For example, methyl chloride, with the standard name chloromethane (see IUPAC books) is an organic compound with a covalent C−Cl bond in which the chlorine is not an anion.', 'Title: Heptanoic acid\nHeptanoic acid, also called enanthic acid, is an organic compound composed of a seven-carbon chain terminating in a carboxylic acid.\n It is an oily liquid with an unpleasant, rancid odor.\n It contributes to the odor of some rancid oils.\n It is slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in ethanol and ether.'], 'reference_contexts': None, 'response': 'Cadmium chloride is slightly soluble in alcohol, which can also be referred
