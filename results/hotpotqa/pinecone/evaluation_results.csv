years after the group\'s break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band\'s unprecedented popularity.\n Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album ""All Things Must Pass"" and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.\n The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between ""Living in the Material World"" and John Lennon\'s primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, ""Plastic Ono Band"".\nTitle:

Best Songs of 2007.', 'In its finished form, the song\'s lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one\'s actions.\n Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts

Love"".\nTitle: List of songs recorded by Syd Barrett\nEnglish musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician.\n One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", contributing to their second one, ""A Saucerful of Secrets"", and recording several unreleased songs with the band.\n Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by

its peak intensity with winds of 215\xa0km/h (130\xa0mph ) on February\xa07.\n The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.', ""These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E.\n The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates, with the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002.\n The last system,

Sea, and is also the strongest named cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.\n The second named tropical cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1, 2007.\n With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235\xa0km/h (145\xa0mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.\n Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.\n It then turned northward into the Gulf of Oman, and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898.\nTitle: Cyclone Kesiny\nTropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first recorded tropical cyclone – the equivalent of a minimal hurricane – to make landfall in the month of May 2002 in the south-west Indian Ocean.\n The final named storm of the busy 2001–02 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kesiny formed on May\xa02 from a trough near the equator.\n Its formation was the result of an increase in the Madden–Julian oscillation, which also contributed to a twin storm in the north Indian Ocean that hit Oman, and another set of storms in northeast and southeast Indian Ocean."", ""After reaching its initial peak as a Category\xa04 cyclone early on 6\xa0May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.\n However, it reintensified into a Category\xa05 cyclone on 8\xa0May.\n Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.\n Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10\xa0May.\n By 16\xa0May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated.\nTitle: 1999 Odisha cyclone\nThe 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD designation BOB 03, JTWC designation 05B) was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region.\n The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.\n The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.\n Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).\n The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.\n The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1 November over the Bay of Bengal.\nTitle: Cyclone Anne\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s.\n The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.\n Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.\n Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.""]","['Title: Kathantara\nKathantara (Odia: କଥାନ୍ତର , English ""Another Story"") is a 2007 Indian Oriya

work to cover their educational costs.\n At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program.\n Students do not have the ability to ""buy"" their way out of the work requirement.\n Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and

most countries.\n It has also seen non-medical use as a performance-enhancing drug.\nTitle: Steroid use in Australia\nAnabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone.\n Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding.\n Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy).\n It is common for teens and adults to use

rotary airlocks.\n Unlike rotary airlock valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore

the last of a series of naturally occurring biologically potent steroid hormones to be isolated and identified between the 1920s to the 1950s, after the androgens, oestrogens, and glucocorticoid

Van Artsdalen (January 31, 1941 – July 18, 1979) was a legendary surfer.\n He moved to La Jolla, California, from his birthplace of Norfolk, Virginia, at age 14.\n Van Artsdalen is best known as a pioneer of surfing 25-foot waves at such North Shore locations as Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach; and tube riding in Hawaii during the early 1960-1970s.\n A member of the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, he appeared in several surf movies and remained a fixture of the international surfing community until his death from alcohol-related illness in 1979.\nTitle: Waimea\nWaimea is a common name in Hawaii and New Zealand.\n In Hawaiian, it means reddish water, but in Maori it has no meaning.\n It may refer to:"", 'Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing.\n Another aspect of skimboarding is ""flatland,"" which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that was too fast and shallow for surfboards.\n Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave.\n Even further, professionals have started getting towed by waverunners into much larger waves.\n Professional Skimboarder, Brad Domke, displayed the new technique in this video.\nTitle: Tow-in surfing\nTow-in surfing is a surfing technique which uses artificial assistance to allow the surfer to catch faster moving waves than was traditionally possible when paddling by hand.\n Tow-in surfing was invented by surfers who wanted to catch big waves and break the 30 foot barrier.\n It has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in surfing history.\nTitle: Waimea Bay, Hawaii\nWaimea Bay is located in Haleiwa on the North Shore of O\'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands at the mouth of the Waimea River.\n Waimea Valley extends behind Waimea Bay.\n ""Waimea"" means ""reddish water"" in Hawaiian.\nTitle: Waimea Canyon State Park\nWaimea Canyon, also known as the ""Grand Canyon of the Pacific"", is a large canyon, approximately ten miles (16\xa0km) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 m) deep, located on the western side of Kauaʻ i in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States.\n Waimea is Hawaiian for ""reddish water"", a reference to the erosion of the canyon\'s red soil.\n The canyon was formed by a deep incision of the Waimea River arising from the extreme rainfall on the island\'s central peak, Mount Waiʻ aleʻ ale, among the wettest places on earth.\nTitle: Butch Van Artsdalen\nCharles M. Van Artsdalen (January 31, 1941 – July 18, 1979) was a legendary surfer.', 'Title: Lake surfing\nLake surfing is surfing on any lake with sufficient surface area for wind to produce suitable waves.\n As with ocean surfing, ideal wave conditions are when the wind switches offshore.\n However, when this occurs over a lake the waves generated by previous onshore wind subside relatively quickly.\n This means lake surfers have a shorter window of opportunity to surf ideal waves.\n Lake surfers are often out during and experiencing the same storm that creates the waves whereas ocean surfers are more often surfing on swell produced by storms hundreds of miles away and that may have taken days to reach shore.\n In addition to making it more difficult to manage surfboards, high winds can make the face of a wave and water surface rough.\n Increased wave frequency due to shorter fetch results in less rest between waves and sets of waves.\n This can make it necessary to paddle out through waves because there may not be a long enough pause between sets to paddle out between them.\n Though not significant enough to necessitate surfboard design changes, the reduced buoyancy of fresh water results in increased drag when paddling.\n Lake surfers enjoy water that is fresh (""sweet"" as opposed to salty) and do not have to worry about the dangers from marine life (e.g. sharks, jellyfish, etc.) that ocean surfers may have to contend with.\nTitle: Eugene Habecker\nDr. Eugene B.

civil war\nThe origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War lie in the continuous political rancor between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Sri Lankan Tamils.\n Before and during the early part of colonial rule by Europeans, Sri Lanka was under the rule of three separate kingdoms.\n War and peace was a status quo between nations, unlike the present status quo of war crimes and terrorism between majorities and minorities.\n During the colonial rule by Portuguese and then the Dutch, the three sovereign states were ruled as separate entities.\n The final British colonial rule amalgamated the entire island into a single administrative entity after independence the minorities were handed over to the mercy of the majority who were warring parties before the period of the European colonisation.\n According to Jonathan Spencer, a social anthropologist from the School of Social and Political Studies of the University of Edinburgh, the war is an outcome of how modern ethnic identities have been made and re-made since the colonial period, with the political struggle between minority Tamils and the Sinhala-dominant government accompanied by rhetorical wars over

modern-day Pakistan) and the colonial government of British India.\n Resentment toward colonial rule had been mounting for many years following the British establishment in the subcontinent.\n There

What produces the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron?,"['This part of the renal tubule is divided into a thin and thick ascending limb; the thick portion is also known as the distal straight tubule, in contrast with the distal convoluted tubule downstream.\nTitle: Angiotensin\nAngiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure.\n It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.\n Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.\n Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up.\nTitle: Tubuloglomerular feedback\nIn the physiology of the kidney, tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) is a feedback system inside the kidneys. Within each nephron, information from the renal tubules (a downstream area of the tubular fluid) is signaled to the glomerulus (an upstream area).\n Tubuloglomerular feedback is one of several mechanisms the kidney uses to regulate glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\n It involves the concept of purinergic signaling, in which an increased distal tubular sodium chloride concentration causes a basolateral release of adenosine from the macula densa cells.\n This initiates a cascade of events that ultimately brings GFR to an appropriate level.', 'They are also called volume receptors.\n These receptors respond to changes in the wall tension, which is proportional to the filling state of the low pressure side of circulation (below 60mmHg).\n Their impulses regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone.\n An elevated atrial pressure produces a decrease in ADH and aldosterone secretion.\n The decrease in vasopressin secretion results in an increase in the volume of urine excreted, serving to lower blood pressure.\n In addition, stretching of atrial receptors increases secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which promotes increased water and sodium excretion through the urine.\nTitle: Renal tubular acidosis\nRenal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine.\n In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other solutes before it drains into the bladder as urine.\n The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule) or by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule).\n Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with renal insufficiency, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys.\n Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes.\nTitle: Ascending limb of loop of Henle\nWithin the nephron of the kidney, the ascending limb of the loop of Henle is a segment of the loop of Henle downstream of the descending limb, after the sharp bend of the loop.\n This part of the renal tubule is divided into a thin and thick ascending limb;
