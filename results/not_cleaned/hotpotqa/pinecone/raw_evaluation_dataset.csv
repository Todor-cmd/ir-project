Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, was a strategic point for commerce and security.\n Kansas City, Missouri was founded in 1838 and defeated its rival Westport to become the predominant city west of St. Louis.\n The area played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States.\n The Santa Fe, and Oregon trails ran through the area.\n In 1854, when Kansas was

Parker who was to usher in the Bebop style in the 1940s.\n According to a Kansas City website, ""While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America\'s music grew up in Kansas City"".\n Kansas City

cost was $43 million.\n Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.\n KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.\n The system employs a

highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.\n While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City

Which dog's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters: the Manchester Terrier or the Scotch Collie?,"['These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs
