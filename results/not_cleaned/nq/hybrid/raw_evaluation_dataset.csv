what purpose did seasonal monsoon winds have on trade,"[""Title: Trade winds\r\nTrade winds - wikipedia  Trade winds  Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the weather phenomenon . For other uses , see Tradewind . The westerlies ( blue arrows ) and trade winds ( yellow and brown arrows )  The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics , within the lower portion of the Earth 's atmosphere , in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth 's equator . The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere , strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase . Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world 's oceans for centuries , and enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans .   In meteorology , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America . Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge . The weaker the trade winds become , the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses .

'' The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the sea '' but also `` return from the sea '' ) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around 30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation , which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta 's voyage in 1565 .   The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all .   By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England 's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of ' trade ' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world 's oceans .

Cause ( edit )  3D map showing Hadley cells in relationship to trade winds on the surface . See also : Air mass , Hadley cell , Humidity , Intertropical Convergence Zone , Monsoon , Monsoon trough , Near - equatorial trough , and Prevailing winds  As part of the Hadley cell circulation , surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles . A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone . When located within a monsoon region , this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough . Around 30 ° in both hemispheres , air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high - pressure belts known as subtropical ridges . The subsident ( sinking ) air is relatively dry because as it descends , the temperature increases , but the absolute humidity remains constant , which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass . This warm , dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical ( warm and moist ) air mass . An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion . When it occurs within a trade wind regime , it is known as a trade wind inversion .   The surface air that flows from these subtropical high - pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect . These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere . Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing , these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere . The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums .   As they blow across tropical regions , air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight ."", ""This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June . Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat , of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) known as the harmattan . The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) , is caused by the sun 's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere . This shift begins from February and ends in June , when the sun is fully overhead , at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis , the sun crosses the equator ( around March ) , moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere . West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time . The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa . Temperatures can climb as high as 35 ° C ( 95.0 ° F ) over west Africa during this time . Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as 48 ° C ( 118.4 ° F ) in cities like Maiduguri .   The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria ( between March to May ) . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of West Africa , is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land . This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) in turn , causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time ( around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria ) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass ( Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) ) , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) finally retreats from most part of Nigeria , and the West African atmosphere around April to May , leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria . The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun . The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth .""]","[""The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics, within the lower portion of the Earth's atmosphere, in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth's equator.

However, historically, seasonal monsoon winds have been crucial for trade, particularly in the Indian Ocean region. These winds allowed for predictable sailing routes, enabling traders to travel between Africa, the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. The monsoon winds facilitated the movement of goods, people, and cultures, significantly impacting trade and cultural exchanges in these regions.",enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans

when is the next deadpool movie being released,"[""Reynolds , Reese , and Wernick had been `` bunkered down , working on the script together , trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make '' . At that time , Goddard joined the project to consult on the script .   By the beginning of March 2017 , Michael Shannon had been in the running to portray Cable , but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict . David Harbour had screen - tested for the role , and Pierce Brosnan was believed to be in negotiations for a part in the film , potentially Cable . Reynolds announced shortly after that Zazie Beetz had been cast as Domino . Later in the month , Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again , and was considered the frontrunner , with Fox also looking at a shortlist of other actors that included Harbour . Brad Pitt had also been considered for the role , and expressed interest in taking it , but had `` moved on '' . Leitch soon addressed the potential casting of these actors , saying Shannon `` would make an incredible Cable ... If that happens , I would be through the roof '' ; and on Pitt , `` We had a great meeting with Brad , he was incredibly interested in the property . Things did n't work out schedule-wise . He 's a fan , and we love him , and I think he would 've made an amazing Cable . '' At the end of March , Morena Baccarin confirmed her return from the first film as Vanessa , and expressed interest in exploring the character 's Copycat persona from the comics in the sequel . Josh Brolin emerged as a `` surprise contender '' to play Cable in April , ahead of Shannon and Harbour , and was officially cast in the role . Brolin also portrays the Marvel Comics character Thanos , in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Leslie Uggams confirmed that she would be reprising her role of Blind Al from the first film , while Fox gave the sequel a June 1 , 2018 release date .   Noting the release date , Leitch wanted to ensure that the film `` was worthy of a summer tentpole movie , and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films '' , specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film `` bigger '' than the first one . However , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '' of combining that with the increased scope . The film uses Deadpool 's fourth wall - breaking to reference this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh and timely when they come up . '' In May 2017 , Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool 2 to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds , Brolin , and Beetz in an X-Force film . Casting for the characters -- Sunspot , Feral , and Shatterstar -- would take place over the coming months , though Reese denied the accuracy of this report . Later , T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return from the first film as Weasel , and described the sequel as `` even more weaselicious '' than the first . He noted that Reynolds and the writers had `` really put the time in on the script '' to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans . Jack Kesy also joined the cast , as Black Tom Cassidy . In June , Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film .   Filming   Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films ."", ""While some reports emerged by mid-March claiming that the reshoots were due to poor audience responses during test screenings of the film , and consisted of sweeping changes , the film was soon confirmed to be testing better than the original did , up to 98 out of 100 over three different tests ( compared to a maximum score of 91 during tests of the first film ) . Because of this , the reshoots were adding more of the elements that audiences responded positively to , including additional material featuring Cable and Domino . By the end of the month , two hours - worth of filming had taken place in Los Angeles for a then - secret cameo appearance , and the film 's first full trailer was released . Officially titling the film Deadpool 2 , the trailer also revealed that Crews was portraying Bedlam ; that Delaney was in the film , portraying Peter ; and that Bill Skarsgård also had a role . The film 's final trailer , released a month later , confirmed that Lewis Tan would portray Shatterstar , joining Domino , Bedlam , and Peter as members of the X-Force in the film .   Music   Deadpool composer Junkie XL chose not to return for the sequel due to Miller 's departure . In October 2017 , Tyler Bates was hired to write the score for the film .   Release   Deadpool 2 is set to be released in the United States on May 18 , 2018 . It was previously scheduled for release on June 1 of that year .   Marketing   For the Fox presentation at CineEurope 2017 in June , Reynolds made a video message featuring himself in costume as Deadpool from the film 's set . The first teaser poster , which pays homage to Norman Rockwell 's 1943 painting Freedom from Want , was released that November . Justin Carter of Comic Book Resources found it `` oddly appropriate for Deadpool 2 to co-opt ( this ) iconic work for a modern pop culture audience '' as it is `` true to Deadpool 's incredibly referential nature . '' Eric Diaz of Nerdist said , `` It strikes exactly the irreverent tone you 'd expect for the Deadpool sequel . '' The first footage from the film debuted the following week , at the end of a video where Reynolds ( in - character as Deadpool ) parodies Bob Ross and his television show The Joy of Painting . The video was described by The Hollywood Reporter 's Ryan Parker as `` completely out of left field '' and setting the tone perfectly for the film , though his colleague Graeme McMillan was less positive due to not knowing of Ross ( Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza thought the fact that many in the audience would n't know of Ross made the video `` exactly the kind of quirky pop culture choice that works perfectly for Deadpool '' ) . Parker added , `` This trailer only showed a few seconds from the film , but fans will be talking about it all day '' because of the presentation , unlike `` any other trailer which would have shown so little of the product . ''   Rather than pay for an expensive advertisement spot during Super Bowl LII , the film 's official Twitter account was used to `` live tweet '' the event with commentary as if the character Deadpool was watching it . A new trailer for the film was released later that week , focusing on introducing Cable . Parker felt that `` Reynolds and company have completely changed the trailer game . The formula of just showing some of the actual movie , but with a tiny story thrown in is such an incredible marketing idea . '' McMillan and their colleague Aaron Couch praised the trailer playing on the visual effects for Cable 's arm not being finished , noting it as a joke about the visual effects to remove Henry Cavill 's mustache from Justice League ."", ""Though the original creative team of Reynolds , Reese , Wernick , and director Tim Miller were quickly set to return for the second film , Miller left the project in October 2016 due to creative differences with Reynolds , and was soon replaced by Leitch . An extensive casting search took place to fill the role of Cable , with Brolin ultimately cast ; the casting of Beetz as Domino was also noteworthy . Filming took place in British Columbia , Canada , from June to October 2017 . During filming , stunt woman Joi `` SJ '' Harris died in a motorcycle accident .   Deadpool 2 is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 18 , 2018 . A sequel , Deadpool 3 , is in development .

where did the idea of fortnite come from,"[""These missions encourage the players to explore the map and farm for resources ( either by searching objects or destroying them with an axe ) used to build the fortifications , weapons , ammunition , and traps needed to defend or attack the husks . Players also frequently need to seek out bluglo , a special resource that does not carry over between maps to activate certain mission objectives . Some missions are considered a loss if the objective is destroyed or time runs out , while other missions allow the players to rework their fortifications and start their defense again if the objective is destroyed . Maps will frequently have optional objectives that are discovered through exploration , such as human survivors that need help . Completing these successfully earn immediate in - game rewards such as resources , weapons , and traps . Missions themselves may provide bonus objectives , such as by completing the mission within a certain in - game period , using a limited number of fortification pieces , or saving more survivors than the minimum necessary , which affects the qualify of rewards the players receive after the successful completion of the main mission .   During missions , players can make their fortifications from one of three base materials ( wood , brick , and metal ) , and in a number of configurations , including floors / ceilings , walls , stairs , and ramps ; players have the ability to edit these for more configurations , such as adding a door or window to a wall . Each fortification part can be upgraded with more resources of the same type to improve their durability , and when they are damaged , can be repaired by spending additional resources . Traps , which have a limited number of activation before they fall apart , can be placed on floors , walls , and ceilings , and arranged in means to make them more lethal or effective against husks . Traps may also include beneficial resources for players , such as healing pads , defender posts , and launch pads . Similarly , players can use a range of weapons but these have limited durability that drops as they are used or as a penalty if the player should be downed by husks and need to respawn without the help of allies . Players can construct new weapons , ammo , and traps from gathered resources , or find these from searching containers across the map . During missions , the game progresses through an accelerated day - night cycle ; during the day , the husks are more passive and do not generally pose immediate threats , while during the night , bands of husks may spawn in and will aggressively seek out players .   One unique mission type is Storm Shield Defense missions . In each of the four world locations , the player is allocated a map that remains persistent , representing the site where their base 's storm shield generator is placed , and in the storm mode , the player must return to this map to expand the storm shield , requiring them to add a new objective to defend successfully to continue the story . At any time , the player can enter this map without starting the defense mission , and use their carried - over resources to build out the fortification and traps , or add resources to a special storage area for this map .   Fortnite is also able to offer themed - events with a unique progression line , new locations , and rewards based on those themes . The first such event was its Halloween event , `` Fortnitemares '' , that offered Halloween - themed heroes , characters , weapons , and traps ( usable outside of the event ) by completing numerous objectives .   Development   History   Fortnite was first revealed at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards ( VGA ) , with Epic 's former design director Cliff Bleszinski introducing a trailer for the game . Donald Mustard , creative lead at Epic , said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea , before we even made the game '' .

As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event , Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite , describing it as `` a world where you explore , you scavenge , you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget , he also echoed these statements , claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that , right ? But creatively for the team , Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' , and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons . ''   As the game was at its very preliminary stages at the VGA reveal , the goal of this reveal was to seek public interest in the title and potential publishing partners as to decide on the game 's release platforms and timeframe . During the July 2012 San Diego Comic Con , Epic announced that Fortnite would be an exclusive personal computer title , and the first one to be developed by Epic using their new Unreal 4 game engine , with a planned release in 2013 . The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time . They further opted for personal computer exclusivity to avoid the difficulty of having to go through console certification , and as they planned to be constantly monitoring and tweaking the game , acting as a dungeon master , the personal computer approach would allow them to do this without restrictions normally set by console manfuctures ."", ""PCGamesN .

which mode is used for short wave broadcast service,"[""Types of modulation ( edit )  Further information : Modulation National Panasonic R3000 analog shortwave receiver , circa 1965  Several different types of modulation are used to impress information on a short - wave transmission .   Amplitude modulation is the simplest type and the most commonly used for shortwave broadcasting . The instantaneous amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the amplitude of the signal ( speech , or music , for example ) . At the receiver , a simple detector recovers the desired modulation signal from the carrier .   Single sideband transmission is a form of amplitude modulation but in effect filters the result of modulation . An amplitude - modulated signal has frequency components both above and below the carrier frequency . If one set of these components is eliminated as well as the residual carrier , only the remaining set is transmitted . This reduces power in the transmission , as roughly 2 / 3 of the energy sent by an AM signal is unnecessary to recover the information contained on it . It also reduces `` bandwidth '' , enabling about one - half the carrier frequency spectrum width to be used . The drawback is the receiver is more complicated , since it must re-create the carrier to recover the signal . Small errors in the detection process greatly affect the pitch of the received signal . As a result , single sideband is not used for music or general broadcast . Single sideband is used for long - range voice communications by ships and aircraft , Citizen 's Band , and amateur radio operators . Lower sideband ( LSB ) is generally used below 9 MHz and USB ( upper sideband ) above 9 MHz .   Vestigal sideband transmits the carrier and one complete sideband , but filters out the other sideband . It is a compromise between AM and SSB , enabing simple receivers to be used , but requires almost as much transmitter power as AM . One advantage is only half the bandwidth of an AM signal is used .

Continuous wave ( CW ) is on - and - off keying of a carrier , used for Morse code communications and Hellschreiber facsimile - based teleprinter transmissions .   Narrow - band frequency modulation ( NBFM ) is used typically above 20 MHz . Because of the larger bandwidth required , NBFM is commonly used for VHF communication . Regulations limit the bandwidth of a signal transmitted in the HF bands , and the advantages of frequency modulation are greatest if the FM signal has a wide bandwidth . NBFM is limited to short - range transmissions due to the multiphasic distortions created by the ionosphere .   Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM ) is a digital modulation for use on bands below 30 MHz .   Radioteletype , fax , digital , slow - scan television and other systems use forms of frequency - shift keying or audio subcarriers on a shortwave carrier .

Propagation characteristics ( edit )  Formation of a skip zone  Shortwave radio frequency energy is capable of reaching any location on the Earth as it is influenced by ionospheric reflection back to the earth by the ionosphere , ( a phenomenon known as `` skywave propagation '' ) . A typical phenomenon of shortwave propagation is the occurrence of a skip zone where reception fails . With a fixed working frequency , large changes in ionospheric conditions may create skip zones at night .   As a result of the multi-layer structure of the ionosphere , propagation often simultaneously occurs on different paths , scattered by the E or F region and with different numbers of hops , a phenomenon that may be disturbed for certain techniques . Particularly for lower frequencies of the shortwave band , absorption of radio frequency energy in the lowest ionospheric layer , the D layer , may impose a serious limit . This is due to collisions of electrons with neutral molecules , absorbing some of a radio frequency 's energy and converting it to heat . Predictions of skywave propagation depend on :    The distance from the transmitter to the target receiver .   Time of day . During the day , frequencies higher than approximately 12 MHz can travel longer distances than lower ones . At night , this property is reversed .   With lower frequencies the dependence on the time of the day is mainly due to the lowest ionospheric layer , the D Layer , forming only during the day when photons from the sun break up atoms into ions and free electrons .   Season . During the winter months of the Northern or Southern hemispheres , the AM / MW broadcast band tends to be more favorable because of longer hours of darkness .   Solar flares produce a large increase in D region ionization so high , sometimes for periods of several minutes , all skywave propagation is nonexistent .

the south west wind blows across nigeria between,"[""This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June . Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat , of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) known as the harmattan . The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) , is caused by the sun 's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere . This shift begins from February and ends in June , when the sun is fully overhead , at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis , the sun crosses the equator ( around March ) , moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere . West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time . The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa . Temperatures can climb as high as 35 ° C ( 95.0 ° F ) over west Africa during this time . Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as 48 ° C ( 118.4 ° F ) in cities like Maiduguri .   The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria ( between March to May ) . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of West Africa , is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land . This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) in turn , causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time ( around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria ) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass ( Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) ) , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) finally retreats from most part of Nigeria , and the West African atmosphere around April to May , leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria . The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun . The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth ."", ""Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from 1,100 mm ( 43.3 in ) in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over 2,000 mm ( 78.7 in ) along the south western escarpment of the Jos Plateau .   The Sahel climate or tropical dry climate , is the predominant climate type in the northern part of Nigeria . Annual rainfall totals are lower compared to the southern and central part of Nigeria . The rainy season in the northern part of Nigeria last for only three to four months ( June -- September ) . The rest of the year is hot and dry with temperatures climbing as high as 40 ° C ( 104.0 ° F ) .   Alpine climate or highland climate or mountain climate are found on highlands regions in Nigeria . Highlands with the alpine climate in Nigeria , are well over 1,520 metres ( 4,987 ft ) above sea level . Due to their location in the tropics , this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands , mountains and the plateau regions standing above this height , a cool mountain climate .   Seasons ( edit )   Nigeria , like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands , has only two seasons . These are the dry season and the rainy season . The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert , locally known as Harmattan , or by its main name , The Tropical Continental ( CT ) airmass , while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean , locally known as the south west wind , or by its main name , The Tropical Maritime ( MT ) airmass . These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the trade winds .

The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa . Temperatures can climb as high as 35 ° C ( 95.0 ° F ) over west Africa during this time . Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as 48 ° C ( 118.4 ° F ) in cities like Maiduguri .   The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria ( between March to May ) ."", ""The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land . This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) in turn , causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time ( around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria ) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass ( Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) ) , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) finally retreats from most part of Nigeria , and the West African atmosphere around April to May , leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria . The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun . The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth . Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the obudu plateau or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of cumulonimbus cloud leading to thunderstorms within the airmass .   During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) in the rainy season of Nigeria , mornings are bright and sunny , the sun 's heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents , these currents rise vertically and cumulonimbus clouds are formed , by afternoons to evenings , torrential downpour follows .   The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria .   The nature of this waves changes at about the 15 degrees line . The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds . Nigeria 's northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees . Nigeria 's location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons .   Tropical continental airmass ( edit )   The Tropical Continental Airmass ( CT ) locally known as the harmattan , is a wind originating from North Africa which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria . This airmass dominates Nigeria 's climate during the dry season from December to March . The Tropical continental airmass is dusty and creates a haze within the atmosphere of west Africa and Nigeria when it predominates . The haze is as a result of the dust within the airmass limiting visibility and blocking much of the sun 's rays from reaching the earth .""]","['With the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) swinging northward over West Africa from the Southern Hemisphere in April, heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of squall lines also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical(south westerlies) and the Continental tropical(north easterlies),[4] begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity, heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria.Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from 1,100 mm (43.3 in) in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over 2,000 mm (78.7 in) along the south western escarpment of the Jos Plateau.[5]', 'With the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) swinging northward over West Africa from the Southern Hemisphere in April, heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of squall lines also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical(south westerlies) and the Continental tropical(north easterlies),[4] begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity, heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria.Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from 1,100 mm (43.3 in) in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over 2,000 mm (78.7 in) along the south western escarpment of the Jos Plateau.[5]']","The south west wind, also known as the Tropical Maritime Airmass (MT), blows across Nigeria from February in the southern part of the country and reaches the northern part by June.",arrives in central Nigeria in July
what does hp mean in war and order,"[""Title: Health (gaming)\r\nHealth ( Gaming ) - wikipedia  Health ( Gaming )  Jump to : navigation , search A health bar , a possible representation of the health of a character .  Health or vitality is an attribute assigned to entities , such as the player character , enemies and objects within a role - playing or video game , that indicates its state in combat . Health is usually measured in hit points or health points , shortened to HP . When the HP of a player character reaches zero , the player may lose a life or their character might become incapacitated or die . When the HP of an enemy reaches zero , it may be defeated or die and the player is usually rewarded in some way .   Any entity within a game could have a health value , including the player character , non-player characters and objects . Indestructible entities have no diminishable health value .   Health might be displayed as a numeric value , such as `` 50 / 100 '' . Here , the first number indicates the current amount of HP an entity has and the second number indicates the entity 's maximum HP . In video games , health can also be displayed graphically , such as with a bar that empties itself when an entity loses health ( a health bar , typically red ) , icons that are `` chipped away '' , or in more novel ways .     Contents  ( hide )   1 History   2 Usage   2.1 Regeneration     3 Display   4 References      History ( edit )   Dungeons & Dragons co-creator Dave Arneson described the origin of hit points in a 2002 interview . When Arneson was adapting the medieval wargame Chainmail ( 1971 ) to a fantasy setting , a process that with Gary Gygax would lead to Dungeons & Dragons , he saw that the emphasis of the gameplay was moving from large armies to small groups of heroes and eventually to the identification of one player and one character that is essential to role - playing as it was originally conceived . Players became attached to their heroes and did not want them to die every time they lost a die roll . Players were thus given multiple hit points which were incrementally decreased as they took damage . Arneson took the concept , along with armor class , from a set of a naval American Civil War game 's rules .   US Navy used similar concept in their tactical war games already in 1920s and 1930s . In their simulation each ship had Life parameter . The unit of Life of the ship was a number of `` equivalent penetrative 14 - inch shell hits '' . The Navy considered ie. that Kongō - class battlecruiser had 12 Life points and Nagato - class battleship had 18.8 .   A visual power meter representing stamina was used in Nintendo 's 1983 arcade game Punch - Out ! ! and Data East 's 1981 DECO Cassette System arcade game Flash Boy .   Usage ( edit )   In action video games as well as in role - playing games , health points can usually be depleted by attacking the entity . A defense attribute might reduce the amount of HP that is lost when a character is damaged . It is common in role - playing games for a character 's maximum health and defense attributes to be gradually raised as the character levels up . In game design , it is deemed important that a player is aware of it when they are losing health , each hit playing a clear sound effect . Author Scott Rogers states that `` health should deplete in an obvious manner , because with every hit , a player is closer to losing their life . '' The display of health also helps to dramatize the near - loss of a life ."", ""Players became attached to their heroes and did not want them to die every time they lost a die roll .

'' The display of health also helps to dramatize the near - loss of a life .   Regeneration ( edit )   Player characters can often restore their health points by consuming certain items , such as health potions , food or first - aid kits . Staying a night at an inn fully restores a character 's health in many role - playing video games . In general , the different methods of regenerating health has its uses in a particular genre . In action games , this method is very quick , whereas role - playing games feature slower paced methods to match the gameplay and realism .   Some video games feature automatically regenerating health , where lost health points are regained over time . This can be useful to not `` cripple '' the player , making them still able to continue even after losing lots of health . However , automatically regenerating health may also cause a player to `` power through '' sections they might otherwise have had to approach cautiously , simply because there are no lasting consequences to losing a large amount of health .   This mechanic initially appeared in action role - playing games , with early examples including the Hydlide series , the Ys series , and Woody Poco . In Woody Poco , the rate at which health recharges is based on food level . In Hydlide and Ys , the player character has to stand still for their health to automatically regenerate . This system was popularized in first - person shooters by Halo : Combat Evolved ( 2001 ) , though regenerating health in The Getaway ( 2002 ) has been cited to be more comparable to later use of the mechanic in first - person shooters .   Display ( edit )  Heart - shaped icons can indicate the amount of health a player has left .  The way health is displayed on the screen has an effect on the player . Many games only show the health of the player character , while keeping the health of enemies hidden . This is done in the Legend of Zelda series , Minecraft and Monster Hunter series to keep the player 's progress in defeating their enemy unclear and therefore exciting . In these games , the fact that the enemies are being damaged is indicated by their behavior ."", ""These can improve a player 's base attributes , attributes that are shared with the other players while on missions , unlock higher levels of evolution for schematics and characters , open up new squad positions , or unlock general skills that players can use in the field . Collectively , the player 's progress on these skill and technology trees , their squad composition , and their selected hero character make up the player 's current `` power level '' which relates to what difficulty of missions the player should take and the game 's matchmaking services . Also , players can review their current story progress and quests , which can include daily , side , and event quests , which when completed provide in - game currency or resources .   Mission is currently divided between four world locations , some available only after progressing far enough in the story , and special locations for timed events and for the Survive the Storm mode . Within a location are several possible mission areas that show the type of mission , the terrain it takes place on , its difficulty rating relative to the player 's current power level , and whether the mission is currently under special `` storm '' conditions that throw random effects , like buffed husks or mini-bosses , into the mission but have potentially better rewards if completed . The player optionally can select a special site that automatically matches them with players at a similar power level and story progression on a random mission for added rewards .   Most missions take place on procedurally - generated landscapes . Most missions are based on locating site ( s ) representing the objectives on the map , build up fortifications around those locations , and then face off against several waves of husks that will try to destroy the objectives . During completion of these missions , players are generally given a `` storm forecast '' to know where husks will spawn in as to enhance fortification in that direction , though this direction can change in more difficult missions . Other missions are time - limited , requiring the players to locate and help a number of survivors , build out several radar towers , or clear out various encampment of husks scattered around the map before time runs out . These missions encourage the players to explore the map and farm for resources ( either by searching objects or destroying them with an axe ) used to build the fortifications , weapons , ammunition , and traps needed to defend or attack the husks . Players also frequently need to seek out bluglo , a special resource that does not carry over between maps to activate certain mission objectives . Some missions are considered a loss if the objective is destroyed or time runs out , while other missions allow the players to rework their fortifications and start their defense again if the objective is destroyed . Maps will frequently have optional objectives that are discovered through exploration , such as human survivors that need help . Completing these successfully earn immediate in - game rewards such as resources , weapons , and traps . Missions themselves may provide bonus objectives , such as by completing the mission within a certain in - game period , using a limited number of fortification pieces , or saving more survivors than the minimum necessary , which affects the qualify of rewards the players receive after the successful completion of the main mission .   During missions , players can make their fortifications from one of three base materials ( wood , brick , and metal ) , and in a number of configurations , including floors / ceilings , walls , stairs , and ramps ; players have the ability to edit these for more configurations , such as adding a door or window to a wall . Each fortification part can be upgraded with more resources of the same type to improve their durability , and when they are damaged , can be repaired by spending additional resources . Traps , which have a limited number of activation before they fall apart , can be placed on floors , walls , and ceilings , and arranged in means to make them more lethal or effective against husks .""]","['Health or vitality is an attribute assigned to entities, such as the player character, enemies and objects within a role-playing or video game, that indicates its state in combat.[1] Health is usually measured in hit points or health points, shortened to HP.

who wrote the first declaration of human rights,"[""Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder `` is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire . '' Kuhrt comments that `` the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof '' of the historicity of Cyrus 's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem , though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts -- an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance .   The German scholar Josef Wiesehöfer summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that `` Many scholars have read into ( ... ) sentences ( from the text of Cylinder ) a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the Judaeans '' and this interpretation was , according to Wiesehöfer , for some scholars a strict belief `` that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder . ''   Human rights ( edit )   The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last Shah of Iran called it `` the world 's first charter of human rights '' . The cylinder was a key symbol of the Shah 's political ideology and is still regarded by some commentators as a charter of human rights , despite the disagreement of some historians and scholars .  Pahlavi Iranian government 's view ( edit ) Cyrus Cylinder at the center of the official emblem of 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire at Pahlavi Iranian imperial era  The Cyrus Cylinder was dubbed the `` first declaration of human rights '' by the pre-Revolution Iranian government , a reading prominently advanced by Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi , in a 1967 book , The White Revolution of Iran . The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids . He wrote that `` the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus , which , for its advocacy of humane principles , justice and liberty , must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind . '' The Shah described Cyrus as the first ruler in history to give his subjects `` freedom of opinion and other basic rights '' . In 1968 , the Shah opened the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights in Tehran by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern Universal Declaration of Human Rights .   In his 1971 Nowruz ( New Year ) speech , the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year , during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy . It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized . The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran 's political system , associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia 's past , and with Cyrus in particular . The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as `` a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create . ''   The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration , and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history . The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities ; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument ( now the Azadi Tower ) in Tehran . The 2,500 year celebrations commenced on October 12 , 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae ."", ""The Cylinder was brought back to London without difficulty , but the British Museum 's Board of Trustees subsequently decided that it would be `` undesirable to make a further loan of the Cylinder to Iran . ''   In 2005 -- 2006 the British Museum mounted a major exhibition on the Persian Empire , Forgotten Empire : the World of Ancient Persia . It was held in collaboration with the Iranian government , which loaned the British Museum a number of iconic artefacts in exchange for an undertaking that the Cyrus Cylinder would be loaned to the National Museum of Iran in return .   The planned loan of the Cylinder was postponed in October 2009 following the June 2009 Iranian presidential election so that the British Museum could be `` assured that the situation in the country was suitable . '' In response , the Iranian government threatened to end cooperation with the British Museum if the Cylinder was not loaned within the following two months . This deadline was postponed despite appeals by the Iranian government but the Cylinder did eventually go on display in Tehran in September 2010 for a four - month period . The exhibition was very popular , attracting 48,000 people within the first ten days and about 500,000 people by the time it closed in January 2011 . However , at its opening , Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad mingled Islamic Republican and ancient Persian symbology which commentators inside and outside Iran criticised as an overt appeal to religious nationalism .   On November 28 , 2012 , the BBC announced the first United States tour of the Cylinder . Under the headline `` British Museum lends ancient ' bill of rights ' cylinder to US '' , Museum director Neil MacGregor declared that `` The cylinder , often referred to as the first bill of human rights , ' must be shared as widely as possible ' '' . The British Museum itself announced the news in its press release , saying `` First declaration of human rights ' to tour five cities in the United States '' . According to the British Museum 's website for the Cylinder 's US exhibition `` CyrusCylinder2013.com '' , the tour started in March 2013 and included Washington DC 's Smithsonian 's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery , the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York , the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco and culminated at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles , in October 2013 .   The cylinder , along with thirty two other associated objects from the British Museum collection , including a pair of gold armlets from the Oxus Treasure and the Darius Seal , were part of an exhibition titled ' The Cyrus Cylinder and Ancient Persia -- A New Beginning ' at the Prince of Wales Museum in Mumbai , India , from December 21 , 2013 to February 25 , 2014 . It was organised by the British Museum and the Prince of Wales Museum in partnership with Sir Dorabji Tata Trust , Sir Ratan Tata Trust and Navajbai Ratan Tata Trust , all set up by luminaries from the Parsi community , who are descendants of Persian Zoroastrians , who hold Cyrus in great regard , as many scholars consider him as a follower of Zoroastrianism .   Freedom Sculpture ( edit )  Main article : Freedom Sculpture The freedom sculpture  The Freedom Sculpture ( Persian : تندیس آزادی \u200e ) is a gold and silver statue located on Santa Monica Boulevard in the Beverly Hills , California .   The design of the Freedom Sculpture was created by artist and architect Cecil Balmond . It is themed on the Cyrus Cylinder from 2,500 years ago , which is sometimes considered the first declaration of human rights . It commemorates the declaration of Cyrus the Great , King of ancient Iran , granting individual and religious freedoms to those within his empire ."", ""It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms , reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus -- a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as `` a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus . '' She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions and that there was no general policy as such . Lester L. Grabbe , a historian of early Judaism , has written that `` the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them '' in tolerating -- but not promoting -- local cults , other than their own gods .   Cyrus may have seen Jerusalem , situated in a strategic location between Mesopotamia and Egypt , as worth patronising for political reasons . His Achaemenid successors generally supported indigenous cults in subject territories as an expression of their legitimacy as rulers , thereby currying favour with the cults ' devotees . Conversely , the Persian kings could , and did , destroy the shrines of peoples who had rebelled against them , as happened at Miletos in 494 BC following the Ionian Revolt . Historian Ernst Badian has noted regarding the Ionian revolt `` ( that ) Harpagus ' devastated ' all of lower Asia ( 1.177 ) is obviously an exaggeration , for the Ionians soon returned to their trading activities . '' The Persians evidently did give permission for its reconstruction , which would have been required given the circumstances of its destruction . However , the Cylinder 's text does not describe any general policy of a return of exiles or mention any sanctuary outside Babylonia ; the biblical historian Bob Becking concludes that `` it has nothing to do with Judeans , Jews or Jerusalem . '' Peter Ross Bedford argues that the Cylinder `` is thus not a manifesto for a general policy regarding indigenous cults and their worshippers throughout the empire . '' Kuhrt comments that `` the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof '' of the historicity of Cyrus 's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem , though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts -- an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance .

who was the governor general of india when country became independent,"[""However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally sovereign princely states or `` native states '' , whose relationship was not with the British government , but directly with the monarch . To reflect the governor - general 's role as the representative of the monarch to the feudal rulers of the princely states , from 1858 the term Viceroy and Governor - General of India ( known in short as the Viceroy of India ) was applied to him .   The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor - general continued to exist in each country separately -- until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively .   Until 1858 , the governor - general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British government ; the Secretary of State for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of his powers . After 1947 , the sovereign continued to appoint the governor - general , but did so on the advice of the Indian government .   Governors - General served at the pleasure of the sovereign , though the practice was to have them serve five - year terms . Governors - General could have their commission rescinded ; and if one was removed , or left , a provisional governor - general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen . The first Governor - General of British India was Warren Hastings , and the first Governor - General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten .

Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were governed by the East India Company , which nominally acted as the agent of the Mughal Emperor . In 1773 , motivated by corruption in the Company , the British government assumed partial control over the governance of India with the passage of the Regulating Act of 1773 . A Governor - General and Supreme Council of Bengal were appointed to rule over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal . The first Governor - General and Council were named in the Act .   The Charter Act 1833 replaced the Governor - General and Council of Fort William with the Governor - General and Council of India . The power to elect the Governor - General was retained by the Court of Directors , but the choice became subject to the Sovereign 's approval .   After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the East India Company 's territories in India were put under the direct control of the Sovereign . The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the Governor - General in the Sovereign . The Governor - General , in turn , had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India , subject to the Sovereign 's approval .   India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947 , but Governors - General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written .

The governor - general ( now also the viceroy ) headed the central government of India , which administered the provinces of British India , including the Punjab , Bengal , Bombay , Madras , the United Provinces , and others . However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally sovereign princely states or `` native states '' , whose relationship was not with the British government , but directly with the monarch . To reflect the governor - general 's role as the representative of the monarch to the feudal rulers of the princely states , from 1858 the term Viceroy and Governor - General of India ( known in short as the Viceroy of India ) was applied to him .   The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor - general continued to exist in each country separately -- until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively .   Until 1858 , the governor - general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British government ; the Secretary of State for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of his powers . After 1947 , the sovereign continued to appoint the governor - general , but did so on the advice of the Indian government .   Governors - General served at the pleasure of the sovereign , though the practice was to have them serve five - year terms . Governors - General could have their commission rescinded ; and if one was removed , or left , a provisional governor - general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen . The first Governor - General of British India was Warren Hastings , and the first Governor - General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten ."", ""Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were governed by the East India Company , which nominally acted as the agent of the Mughal Emperor . In 1773 , motivated by corruption in the Company , the British government assumed partial control over the governance of India with the passage of the Regulating Act of 1773 . A Governor - General and Supreme Council of Bengal were appointed to rule over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal . The first Governor - General and Council were named in the Act .   The Charter Act 1833 replaced the Governor - General and Council of Fort William with the Governor - General and Council of India . The power to elect the Governor - General was retained by the Court of Directors , but the choice became subject to the Sovereign 's approval .   After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the East India Company 's territories in India were put under the direct control of the Sovereign . The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the Governor - General in the Sovereign . The Governor - General , in turn , had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India , subject to the Sovereign 's approval .   India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947 , but Governors - General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written . Louis Mountbatten , 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma remained Governor - General of India for some time after independence , but the two nations were otherwise headed by native Governors - General . India became a secular republic in 1950 ; Pakistan became an Islamic one in 1956 .   Functions ( edit )  Lord Curzon in his robes as Viceroy of India , a post he held from 1899 to 1905 . Lord Mountbatten addressing the Chamber of Princes as Crown Representative in the 1940s  The Governor - General originally had power only over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal . The Regulating Act , however , granted them additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence . The other Presidencies of the East India Company ( Madras , Bombay and Bencoolen ) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the Governor - General and Council of Fort William .   The powers of the Governor - General , in respect of foreign affairs , were increased by the India Act 1784 . The Act provided that the other Governors under the East India Company could not declare war , make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the Governor - General or by the Company 's Court of Directors .   While the Governor - General thus became the controller of foreign policy in India , he was not the explicit head of British India . That status came only with the Charter Act 1833 , which granted him `` superintendence , direction and control of the whole civil and military Government '' of all of British India . The Act also granted legislative powers to the Governor - General and Council .   After 1858 , the Governor - General ( now usually known as the Viceroy ) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the Sovereign 's representative . India was divided into numerous provinces , each under the head of a Governor , Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator . Governors were appointed by the British Government , to whom they were directly responsible ; Lieutenant Governors , Chief Commissioners , and Administrators , however , were appointed by and were subordinate to the Viceroy . The Viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers : the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Maharaja of Mysore , the Maharaja ( Scindia ) of Gwalior , the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad ( Gaekwar ) Maharaja of Baroda .""]","['India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but Governors-General continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written.

The team play in the Championship , the second tier of English football .   Reading are nicknamed The Royals , due to Reading 's location in the Royal County of Berkshire , though they were previously known as The Biscuitmen , due to the town 's association with Huntley and Palmers . Established in 1871 , the club is one of the oldest teams in England , but did not join The Football League until 1920 , and had never played in the top tier of English football league system before the 2006 -- 07 season . The club competed in the 2012 -- 13 Premier League season , having gained promotion at the end of the 2011 -- 12 season after winning the Championship , but were relegated after just one season back in the top flight .   The club played at Elm Park for 102 years between 1896 and 1998 . In 1998 the club moved to the new Madejski Stadium , which is named after the club 's co-chairman Sir John Madejski .   The club holds the record for the number of successive league wins at the start of a season , with a total of 13 wins at the start of the 1985 -- 86 Third Division campaign and also the record for the number of points gained in the professional league season with 106 points in the 2005 -- 06 Football League Championship campaign . Reading then finished eighth in the 2006 -- 07 Premier League , their first ever season as a top flight club .

When the three teams had shared a division , their rivalry was referred to as the `` Didcot Triangle '' . However , the rivalry between Oxford and Swindon is stronger than between either of the two and Reading , largely due to them both spending their recent history in lower divisions than Reading , and spending their previous history in higher divisions than Reading . In 2012 , a small survey showed that Reading 's main rivals were Aldershot Town , followed by Swindon Town and Oxford United .

Types ( edit )   Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are divided into two types .   Intravascular haemolysis ( edit )   The most common cause of this reaction is ABO blood groups incompatibility , secondary to human errors . In this process , the donor 's red blood cells are destroyed by recipient 's preformed antibodies through the activation of complement system . Thus , the donor 's red blood cells break open and releases haemoglobin into the blood . The haemoglobin is then excreted into urine , causes haemoglobinuria . Meanwhile , haemoglobin can also pass through the liver system and process into bilirubin , which accumulates under the skin , causing jaundice . The release of red blood cell debris and the activation of complement system causes uncontrolled clotting ( disseminated intravascular coagulation ) and circulatory shock .   Extravascular haemolysis ( edit )   In this case , the donor 's red blood cells are recognised and bound to IgG antibodies . Macrophages then recognise these IgG antibodies and engulf these red blood cells , removing the red blood cells from the blood circulation into liver and spleen . These red blood cells are then destroyed by macrophages in these organs . Anti-Rh antibodies most commonly directed this type of reaction . This process is much more controlled when compared with intravascular haemolysis . Liver has adequate capacity in processing the bilirubin . Therefore , jaundice rarely occurs .

Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details . ( January 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction ( AHTR ) is a type of transfusion reaction that is associated with hemolysis . It occurs very soon after the transfusion , and within 24 hrs post-transfusion . It can occur quickly upon transfusing a few milliliters , or up to 1 -- 2 hours post-transfusion .   It is also known as an `` immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction '' . This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies ( IgG , IgM ) . It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood . Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood , facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade . The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) may also occur . The most common cause is clerical error ( i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient ) .

In this process , the donor 's red blood cells are destroyed by recipient 's preformed antibodies through the activation of complement system . Thus , the donor 's red blood cells break open and releases haemoglobin into the blood . The haemoglobin is then excreted into urine , causes haemoglobinuria . Meanwhile , haemoglobin can also pass through the liver system and process into bilirubin , which accumulates under the skin , causing jaundice . The release of red blood cell debris and the activation of complement system causes uncontrolled clotting ( disseminated intravascular coagulation ) and circulatory shock .   Extravascular haemolysis ( edit )   In this case , the donor 's red blood cells are recognised and bound to IgG antibodies .""]","['It is also known as an ""immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction"".[3] This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies (IgG, IgM). It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood. Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood, facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade. The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) may also occur. The most common cause is clerical error (i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient).']","In an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, the donor's red blood cells (RBCs) are rapidly destroyed by the recipient's antibodies. This can occur through two main mechanisms:

1. **Intravascular Hemolysis**: This is often due to ABO blood group incompatibility. The recipient's preformed antibodies activate the complement system, leading to the destruction of the donor's RBCs within the blood vessels. This releases hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which can cause hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin in urine) and jaundice due to bilirubin accumulation. It can also lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and circulatory shock.

2. **Extravascular Hemolysis**: In this case, the donor's RBCs are recognized and bound by IgG antibodies. Macrophages then engulf these antibody-coated RBCs, removing them from circulation and destroying them in the liver and spleen. This process is more controlled compared to intravascular hemolysis, and jaundice is less common because the liver can process the bilirubin adequately.

In both cases, the destruction of RBCs can lead to complications such as kidney failure and DIC.",rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies

( January 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     The U.S. Army Air Corps had established the Psychological Research Unit 1 at Maxwell Army Air Field , Montgomery , Alabama , and other units around the country for aviation cadet training , which included the identification , selection , education , and training of pilots , navigators , and bombardiers . Psychologists employed in these research studies and training programs used some of the first standardized tests to quantify IQ , dexterity and leadership qualities to select and train the best - suited personnel for the roles of bombardier , navigator , and pilot . The Air Corps determined that the existing programs would be used for all units , including all - black units . At Tuskegee , this effort continued with the selection and training of the Tuskegee Airmen . The War Department set up a system to accept only those with a level of flight experience or higher education which ensured that only the most able and intelligent African - American applicants were able to join .   The first Lady 's flight ( edit )   The budding flight program at Tuskegee received a publicity boost when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt inspected it in March 1941 , and flew with African - American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred `` Chief '' Anderson . Anderson , who had been flying since 1929 , and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots , took his prestigious passenger on a half - hour flight in a Piper J - 3 Cub . After landing , she cheerfully announced , `` Well , you can fly all right . ''   The subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady 's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the CPTP at Tuskegee , even though the program was already five months old . Eleanor Roosevelt used her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field .   Formation ( edit )  Major James A.

This small number of enlisted men became the core of other black squadrons forming at Tuskegee and Maxwell Fields in Alabama .   The Tuskegee program officially began June 1941 with the 99th Pursuit Squadron at Tuskegee University . The unit consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men , and was backed by an entire service arm . After primary training at Moton Field , they were moved to the nearby Tuskegee Army Air Field , about 10 miles ( 16 km ) to the west for conversion training onto operational types . Consequently , Tuskegee Army Air Field became the only Army installation performing three phases of pilot training ( basic , advanced , and transition ) at a single location .

War poster featuring a Tuskegee Airman  Tuskegee Army Airfield was similar to already - existing airfields reserved for training white pilots , such as Maxwell Field , only 40 miles ( 64 km ) distant . African - American contractor McKissack and McKissack , Inc. was in charge of the contract . The company 's 2,000 workmen , the Alabama Works Progress Administration , and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months . The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057 . The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis , Jr. , one of only two black line officers then serving .   During training , Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison . Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee . However , he was transferred on 12 January 1942 , reputedly because of his insistence that his African - American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local Caucasian civilians .   His successor , Colonel Frederick von Kimble , then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield . Contrary to new Army regulations , Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama , a policy that was resented by the airmen . Later that year , the Air Corps replaced Kimble . His replacement had been the director of instruction at Tuskegee Army Airfield , Major Noel F. Parrish . Counter to the prevalent racism of the day , Parrish was fair and open - minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat .

They formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces . The name also applies to the navigators , bombardiers , mechanics , instructors , crew chiefs , nurses , cooks and other support personnel .   All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Moton Field , the Tuskegee Army Air Field , and were educated at Tuskegee University , located near Tuskegee , Alabama . The group included five Haitians from the Haitian Air Force , and one pilot from Trinidad. . It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic .   Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B - 25 Mitchell bombers , they never served in combat . The 99th Pursuit Squadron ( later , 99th Fighter Squadron ) was the first black flying squadron , and the first to deploy overseas ( to North Africa in April 1943 , and later to Sicily and Italy ) . The 332nd Fighter Group , which originally included the 100th , 301st , and 302nd Fighter Squadrons , was the first black flying group . It deployed to Italy in early 1944 . In June 1944 , the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions , and in July 1944 , with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron , it had four fighter squadrons .   The 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with Curtiss P - 40 Warhawk fighter - bomber aircraft . The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th , 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P - 39 Airacobras ( March 1944 ) , later with Republic P - 47 Thunderbolts ( June -- July 1944 ) , and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated , the North American P - 51 Mustang ( July 1944 ) . When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P - 47s red , the nickname `` Red Tails '' was coined . The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P - 51s as well as a red rudder ; the P - 51B and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes , with red propeller spinners , yellow wing bands and all - red tail surfaces .""]","['All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Moton Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field, and were educated at Tuskegee University, located near Tuskegee, Alabama.

The team has an intense rivalry with the New York Giants . This rivalry is the oldest in the NFC East and is among the oldest in the NFL . It was ranked by NFL Network as the number one rivalry of all - time and Sports Illustrated ranks it amongst the Top 10 NFL rivalries of all - time at number four , and according to ESPN , it is one of the fiercest and most well - known rivalries in the American football community . They also have a bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys , which has become more high - profile since the 1960s , as well as a historic rivalry with the Washington Redskins . Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers is another bitter rivalry , roughly dating back to 1933 , that mostly arises from the two teams ' statuses as being from opposite ends of the same state .   The team consistently ranks in the top three in attendance and has sold out every game since the 1999 season . In a Sports Illustrated poll of 321 NFL players , Eagles fans were selected the most intimidating fans in the NFL .

In the next game Foles and the Eagles annihilated the Minnesota Vikings 38 -- 7 in the NFC Championship nicknamed the Minneapolis Massacre , mocking the Minneapolis Miracle from their previous playoff victory . Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and 3 touchdowns including an impressive flea flicker touchdown pass . This win marked the franchise 's third Super Bowl appearance and a berth in Super Bowl LII for a 2005 rematch against Tom Brady and the New England Patriots .   With Foles at the helm , the Eagles started off the game strong , leading the Patriots 22 -- 12 at halftime . In the second half the Patriots gained momentum and for the first time took the lead in the 4th quarter 33 -- 32 . The Eagles rallied back and scored an 11 - yard Touchdown to tight end Zach Ertz . Later the Eagles converted on a 46 - yard field goal by Jake Elliott to lead 41 -- 33 . On the final play of the game with 9 seconds left , Brady threw a hail - mary pass directed toward tight end Rob Gronkowski which was bobbled by Patrick Robinson before being dropped in the end - zone as time expired , securing the win for the Eagles 41 -- 33 , and ending the 58 - year long championship drought . This would be Philadelphia 's first Super Bowl win and their fourth league championship ( their first championship since 1960 ) . Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 -- 43 with 373 passing yards , 3 touchdowns , and an interception .

The music was composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ( his opus 66 ) . The score was completed in 1889 , and is the second of his three ballets . The original scenario was conceived by Ivan Vsevolozhsky , and is based on Charles Perrault 's La Belle au bois dormant . The choreographer of the original production was Marius Petipa .   The premiere performance took place at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on January 15 , 1890 . The work has become one of the classical repertoire 's most famous ballets .

It was later decided that Charles Perrault 's La Belle au bois dormant would be the story for which Tchaikovsky would compose the music for the ballet . Tchaikovsky did not hesitate to accept the commission , although he was aware that his only previous ballet , Swan Lake , met with little enthusiasm at that stage of his career .   The ballet scenario that Tchaikovsky worked on was based on the Brothers Grimm 's version of Perrault 's work entitled ' Dornröschen ' . In that version , the Princess 's parents ( the King and the Queen ) survived the 100 - year sleep to celebrate the Princess 's wedding to the Prince . However , Vsevolozhsky incorporated Perrault 's other characters from his stories into the ballet , such as Puss in Boots , Little Red Riding Hood , Cinderella , Bluebird , Bluebeard , Ricky of the Tuft and Tom Thumb . Other French fairy tale characters to be featured are Beauty and the Beast , Pretty Goldilocks and The White Cat . Regardless , Tchaikovsky was happy to inform the Director of the Imperial Theatre that he had great pleasure studying the work and had come away with adequate inspiration to do it justice .   The choreographer was Marius Petipa , ballet master of the Imperial Ballet , who wrote a very detailed list of instructions as to the musical requirements . Tchaikovsky worked quickly on the new work at Frolovskoye ; he began initial sketches in the winter of 1888 and began orchestration on the work on 30 May 1889 ."", ""20   Sleeping Beauty , Op. 66   The Nutcracker , Op. 71       List of compositions by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky               The ballets and * revivals of Marius Petipa in Russia     1847 -- 59     Paquita ( * 1847 , * 1881 )   Le Diable amoureux ( as `` Satanella '' ) ( * 1848 )   Leda , the Swiss Milkmaid ( 1849 )   Giselle ( * 1850 , * 1884 , * 1899 , * 1903 )   The Star of Granada ( 1855 )   The Rose , the Violet , and the Butterfly ( 1857 )   Le Corsaire ( * 1858 , * 1863 , * 1868 , * 1885 , * 1899 )   A Marriage During the Regency ( 1858 )   The Parisian Market ( 1859 , * 1861 )       1860 -- 79     The Blue Dahlia ( 1860 , * 1875 )   Terpsichore ( 1861 )   The Pharaoh 's Daughter ( 1862 , * 1885 , * 1898 )   The Beauty of Lebanon ( 1863 )   The Traveling Dancer ( 1864 )   Florida ( 1866 )   Titania ( 1866 )   Faust ( * 1867 )   The Benevolent Cupid ( 1868 )   The Slave ( 1868 )   Le Roi Candaule ( 1868 , * 1891 , * 1903 )   Don Quixote ( 1869 , * 1871 )   Trilby ( 1870 )   Catarina ( * 1870 )   The Two Stars ( 1871 )   La Péri ( * 1872 )   Camargo ( 1872 )   Le Papillon ( * 1874 )   Ondine ( as `` The Naiad and the Fisherman '' ) ( * 1874 , * 1892 )   The Bandits ( 1875 )   The Adventures of Peleus ( 1876 , * 1897 )   A Midsummer Night 's Dream ( 1876 )   La Bayadère ( 1877 , * 1900 )   Roxana ( 1878 )   Ariadne ( 1878 )   The Daughter of the Snows ( 1879 )   Frizak the Barber ( 1879 )   Mlada ( 1879 , * 1896 )       1880 -- 99     La Fille du Danube ( * 1880 )   Zoraiya ( 1881 )   La Vivandière ( as `` Markitenka '' ) ( * 1881 )   Pâquerette ( * 1882 )   The Night and the Day ( 1883 )   Pygmalion ( 1883 )   Coppélia ( * 1884 )   Giselle ( * 1884 , 1899 , 1903 )   Le Diable à Quatre ( as `` The Willful Wife '' ) ( * 1885 )   La Fille Mal Gardée ( * 1885 )   The Magic Pills ( 1886 )   The King 's Command ( 1886 , * 1887 , * 1900 )   La Esmeralda ( * 1886 , * 1899 )   The Sacrifices to Cupid ( 1886 )   * Fiametta ( 1887 )   The Vestal ( 1888 )   The Talisman ( 1889 ,""]","['\n\nBallets by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\n\n\nSwan Lake (1876)\nSleeping Beauty (1889)\nThe Nutcracker (1892)\nList of all compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n', '\n\nBallets by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\n\n\nSwan Lake (1876)\nSleeping Beauty (1889)\nThe Nutcracker (1892)\nList of all compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n', '\n\nBallets by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\n\n\nSwan Lake (1876)\nSleeping Beauty (1889)\nThe Nutcracker (1892)\nList of all compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n', '\n\nBallets by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\n\n\nSwan Lake (1876)\nSleeping Beauty (1889)\nThe Nutcracker (1892)\nList of all compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n', '\n\nBallets by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\n\n\nSwan Lake (1876)\nSleeping Beauty (1889)\nThe Nutcracker (1892)\nList of all compositions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\nt\ne\n\n\n\n\n']","Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker are three famous ballets composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.",Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky

There 's no doubt who we should choose -- Hargitay and Meloni . '' Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together , and they ended up being his first choice . Garth Ancier , then head of NBC Entertainment , agreed , and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent .   The first actor to be cast for the show was Dann Florek . Florek had originated the character of Captain Don Cragen in the 1988 pilot for Law & Order and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives , who wanted to add female characters to the all male primary cast . He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf , however , and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show . Shortly after Florek reprised his role for Exiled : A Law & Order Movie , he received a call to be on Sex Crimes . Initially reluctant , he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role .   Shortly after the cancellation of Homicide : Life on the Street , Richard Belzer heard that Benjamin Bratt had left Law & Order . Belzer requested his manager to call Wolf and pitch the idea for Belzer 's character from Homicide , Detective John Munch , to become the new partner of Jerry Orbach 's character , Detective Lennie Briscoe , since they had previously teamed in three Homicide crossovers . Wolf loved the idea , but had already cast Jesse L. Martin as Briscoe 's new partner , Detective Ed Green . The idea was reconfigured , however , to have Munch on Law & Order : Special Victims Unit instead . Since the character of Munch was inspired by David Simon 's depiction of Detective Sergeant Jay Landsman and developed for Homicide by Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson , the addition of Munch to the cast required the consent of all three . The appropriate agreements were reached and , while Fontana and Levinson agreed to waive their royalty rights , contracts with Simon required that he be paid royalties for any new show in which Munch is a main character ; as a result , Simon receives royalties every time Munch appears in an episode of the show .   Dean Winters was cast as Munch 's partner , Brian Cassidy , at the insistence of Belzer . Belzer looked at Winters as a sort of little brother , and told Wolf , `` Well , I 'll do this new show of yours , SVU , only if you make Dean Winters my partner . '' Wolf did make Winters Belzer 's partner , but he was contractually obligated to his other show at the time , the HBO drama Oz .""]","['\n\nCast\nCharacter\nRank/Position\nSeasons\nNotes\n\n\nRegular\nRecurring\nGuest\n\n\nChristopher Meloni\nElliot Stabler\nDetective\n1–12\n\n\n[O 1]\n\n\nMariska Hargitay\nOlivia Benson\nLieutenant\n1–\n\n\n[N 1][O 2]\n\n\nRichard Belzer\nJohn Munch\nDA Investigator\n1–15\n\n15, 17\n[N 2]\n\n\nDann Florek\nDonald Cragen\nCaptain\n1–15\n\n16\n[N 3]\n\n\nMichelle Hurd\nMonique Jeffries\nDetective\n1–2\n1\n\n\n\n\nStephanie March\nAlexandra Cabot\nAssistant District Attorney\n2–5, 11\n2, 10, 13\n6\n\n\n\nIce-T\nOdafin ""Fin"" Tutuola\nDetective\n2–\n\n\n\n\n\nTamara Tunie\nMelinda Warner\nMedical Examiner\n7–12\n2–6, 13–17\n19\n\n\n\nB.

what is the first step in the evolution of the eye,"[""These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup , which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions , then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened . While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light , as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo - sensitive cells regardless of its direction , the `` cup '' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light 's angle . Pit eyes , which had arisen by the Cambrian period , were seen in ancient snails , and are found in some snails and other invertebrates living today , such as planaria . Planaria can slightly differentiate the direction and intensity of light because of their cup - shaped , heavily pigmented retina cells , which shield the light - sensitive cells from exposure in all directions except for the single opening for the light . However , this proto - eye is still much more useful for detecting the absence or presence of light than its direction ; this gradually changes as the eye 's pit deepens and the number of photoreceptive cells grows , allowing for increasingly precise visual information .   When a photon is absorbed by the chromophore , a chemical reaction causes the photon 's energy to be transduced into electrical energy and relayed , in higher animals , to the nervous system . These photoreceptor cells form part of the retina , a thin layer of cells that relays visual information , including the light and day - length information needed by the circadian rhythm system , to the brain . However , some jellyfish , such as Cladonema , have elaborate eyes but no brain . Their eyes transmit a message directly to the muscles without the intermediate processing provided by a brain .   During the Cambrian explosion , the development of the eye accelerated rapidly , with radical improvements in image - processing and detection of light direction .  The primitive nautilus eye functions similarly to a pinhole camera .  After the photosensitive cell region invaginated , there came a point when reducing the width of the light opening became more efficient at increasing visual resolution than continued deepening of the cup . By reducing the size of the opening , organisms achieved true imaging , allowing for fine directional sensing and even some shape - sensing . Eyes of this nature are currently found in the nautilus . Lacking a cornea or lens , they provide poor resolution and dim imaging , but are still , for the purpose of vision , a major improvement over the early eyepatches .   Overgrowths of transparent cells prevented contamination and parasitic infestation . The chamber contents , now segregated , could slowly specialize into a transparent humour , for optimizations such as colour filtering , higher refractive index , blocking of ultraviolet radiation , or the ability to operate in and out of water . The layer may , in certain classes , be related to the moulting of the organism 's shell or skin . An example of this can be observed in Onychophorans where the cuticula of the shell continues to the cornea . The cornea is composed of either one or two cuticular layers depending on how recently the animal has moulted . Along with the lens and two humors , the cornea is responsible for converging light and aiding the focusing of it on the back of the retina . The cornea protects the eyeball while at the same time accounting for approximately 2 / 3 of the eye 's total refractive power .   It is likely that a key reason eyes specialize in detecting a specific , narrow range of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum -- the visible spectrum -- is because the earliest species to develop photosensitivity were aquatic , and only two specific wavelength ranges of electromagnetic radiation , blue and green visible light , can travel through water ."", ""But in the eyes of deuterostomes , they are derived from cilia , which are separate structures . However , outside the eyes an organism may use the other type of photoreceptor cells , for instance the clamworm Platynereis dumerilii uses microvilliar cells in the eyes but has additionally deep brain ciliary photoreceptor cells . The actual derivation may be more complicated , as some microvilli contain traces of cilia -- but other observations appear to support a fundamental difference between protostomes and deuterostomes . These considerations centre on the response of the cells to light -- some use sodium to cause the electric signal that will form a nerve impulse , and others use potassium ; further , protostomes on the whole construct a signal by allowing more sodium to pass through their cell walls , whereas deuterostomes allow less through .   This suggests that when the two lineages diverged in the Precambrian , they had only very primitive light receptors , which developed into more complex eyes independently .   Early eyes ( edit )   The basic light - processing unit of eyes is the photoreceptor cell , a specialized cell containing two types of molecules in a membrane : the opsin , a light - sensitive protein , surrounding the chromophore , a pigment that distinguishes colors . Groups of such cells are termed `` eyespots '' , and have evolved independently somewhere between 40 and 65 times . These eyespots permit animals to gain only a very basic sense of the direction and intensity of light , but not enough to discriminate an object from its surroundings .   Developing an optical system that can discriminate the direction of light to within a few degrees is apparently much more difficult , and only six of the thirty - some phyla possess such a system . However , these phyla account for 96 % of living species .  The planarian has `` cup '' eyespots that can slightly distinguish light direction .  These complex optical systems started out as the multicellular eyepatch gradually depressed into a cup , which first granted the ability to discriminate brightness in directions , then in finer and finer directions as the pit deepened . While flat eyepatches were ineffective at determining the direction of light , as a beam of light would activate exactly the same patch of photo - sensitive cells regardless of its direction , the `` cup '' shape of the pit eyes allowed limited directional differentiation by changing which cells the lights would hit depending upon the light 's angle .

The evolution of the eye is attractive to study , because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms . Complex , image - forming eyes have evolved independently several times . The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion . According his theory , the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells ( so called Pax 6 genes ) appeared probably at once in the life history , at a very early stage of the evolution . Probably , the complex , image forming kinds of eyes are at least five : Chidaria - lens eye , complex eye ; Molluscs - lens eye , everse retina ; Annelids - lens eye , everse retina ; Arthropods - facet eye ; Vertebrate - lens eye , inverse retina   Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion . From before the Cambrian , no evidence of eyes has survived , but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian , and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale . Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners . They vary in their visual acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light , their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colours .

Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species , that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance `` absurd in the highest possible degree '' . However , he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it , its evolution was perfectly feasible :   ... if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist , each grade being useful to its possessor , as is certainly the case ; if further , the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited , as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory .   He suggested a stepwise evolution from `` an optic nerve merely coated with pigment , and without any other mechanism '' to `` a moderately high stage of perfection '' , and gave examples of existing intermediate steps . Darwin 's suggestions were soon shown to be correct , and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution .   Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors . Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates .

where is the tv show the curse of oak island filmed,"[""The series discusses the history of the island , recent discoveries , theories , and prior attempts to investigate the site . Areas of interest include the `` Money Pit '' , Borehole 10 - x , Smith 's Cove , `` Nolan 's Cross '' , the `` Hatch '' , the `` Watchtower '' and the `` Swamp '' .   Background ( edit )   The Lagina brothers became fascinated with the island after reading the January 1965 issue of Reader 's Digest magazine that features an article on the Restall family 's work to investigate the so - called `` Money Pit '' . Marty and his brother Rick obtained a controlling interest in Oak Island Tours , which reportedly owns most of the island . The brothers were later approached by Prometheus Entertainment to do a reality show . Rick and Marty have engaged the assistance of father - and - son Dan and Dave Blankenship , permanent residents of the island who have likewise been searching for treasure since the 1960s .   Theories ( edit )   The series explores various Oak Island theories and conjectures through conversations with independent researchers .

In humans , the pear - shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver , although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species . It receives and stores bile , produced by the liver , via the common hepatic duct , and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum , where the bile helps in the digestion of fats .   The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones , formed by material that can not be dissolved -- usually cholesterol or bilirubin , a product of haemoglobin breakdown . These may cause significant pain , particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen , and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy . Cholecystitis , inflammation of the gallbladder , has a wide range of causes , including result from the impaction of gallstones , infection , and autoimmune disease .

In adults , the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres ( 2.8 to 3.9 inches ) in length and 4 centimetres ( 1.6 in ) in diameter when fully distended . The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres ( 1.8 imperial fluid ounces ) .   The gallbladder is shaped like a pear , with its tip opening into the cystic duct . The gallbladder is divided into three sections : the fundus , body , and neck . The fundus is the rounded base , angled so that it faces the abdominal wall . The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver . The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct , part of the biliary tree . The gallbladder fossa , against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie , is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V . The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct . At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct , there is an out - pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as `` Hartmann 's pouch '' ."", ""Cystic duct , 6 .

The front border of the liver has been lifted up ( brown arrow ) .  The main purpose of the gallbladder is to store bile , also called gall , needed for the digestion of fats in food . Produced by the liver , bile flows through small vessels into the larger hepatic ducts and ultimately though the cystic duct ( parts of the biliary tree ) into the gallbladder , where it is stored . At any one time , 30 to 60 millilitres ( 1.0 to 2.0 US fl oz ) of bile is stored within the gallbladder .   When food containing fat enters the digestive tract , it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin ( CCK ) from I cells of the duodenum and jejunum . In response to cholecystokinin , the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct , eventually draining into the duodenum . The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food , thereby assisting their absorption . Bile consists primarily of water and bile salts , and also acts as a means of eliminating bilirubin , a product of hemoglobin metabolism , from the body .   The bile that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder is not the same as the bile that is secreted by the gallbladder . During gallbladder storage of bile , it is concentrated by removal of some water and electrolytes . This is through the active transport of sodium ions across the epithelium of the gallbladder , which creates an osmotic pressure that also causes water and other electrolytes such as chloride to be reabsorbed .   Clinical significance ( edit )  Main article : Gallbladder disease  Gallstones ( edit )  Main article : Gallstones  Gallstones form when the bile is saturated , usually with either cholesterol or bilirubin . Most gallstones do not cause symptoms , with stones either remaining in the gallbladder or passed along the biliary system . When symptoms occur , severe `` colicky '' pain in the upper right part of the abdomen is often felt . If the stone blocks the gallbladder , inflammation known as cholecystitis may result . If the stone lodges in the biliary system , jaundice may occur ; and if the stone blocks the pancreatic duct , then pancreatitis may occur . Gallstones are diagnosed using ultrasound . When a symptomatic gallstone occurs , it is often managed by waiting it to be passed naturally . Given the likelihood of recurrent gallstones , surgery to remove the gallbladder is often considered . Some medication , such as ursodeoxycholic acid , may be used ; and lithotripsy , a procedure used to break down the stones , may also be used .   Inflammation ( edit )  Main article : Cholecystitis  Known as cholecystitis , inflammation of the gallbladder is commonly caused by obstruction of the duct with gallstones , which is known as cholelithiasis ."", ""In adults , the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres ( 2.8 to 3.9 inches ) in length and 4 centimetres ( 1.6 in ) in diameter when fully distended .

At the junction of the neck of the gallbladder and the cystic duct , there is an out - pouching of the gallbladder wall forming a mucosal fold known as `` Hartmann 's pouch '' .   Microanatomy ( edit )  Micrograph of a normal gallbladder wall . H&E stain .  The gallbladder wall is composed of a number of layers . The gallbladder wall 's innermost surface is lined by a single layer of columnar cells with a brush border of microvilli , very similar to intestinal absorptive cells . Underneath the epithelium is an underlying lamina propria , a muscular layer , an outer perimuscular layer and serosa . Unlike elsewhere in the intestinal tract , the gallbladder does not have a muscularis mucosae , and the muscular fibres are not arranged in distinct layers .   The mucosa , the inner portion of the gallbladder wall , consists of a lining of a single layer of columnar cells , with cells possessing small hair - like attachments called microvilli . This sits on a thin layer of connective tissue , the lamina propria . The mucosa is curved and collected into tiny outpouchings called rugae .   A muscular layer sits beneath the mucosa . This is formed by smooth muscle , with fibres that lie in longitudinal , oblique and transverse directions , and are not arranged in separate layers . The muscle fibres here contract to expel bile from the gallbladder . A distinctive feature of the gallbladder is the presence of Rokitansky -- Aschoff sinuses , deep outpouchings of the mucosa that can extend through the muscular layer . The muscular layer is surrounded by a layer of connective and fat tissue .   The outer layer of the fundus of gallbladder , and the surfaces not in contact with the liver , are covered by a thick serosa , which is exposed to the peritoneum . The serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics . The surfaces in contact with the liver are covered in connective tissue .   Variation ( edit )   The gallbladder varies in size , shape , and position between different people . Rarely , two or even three gallbladders may coexist , either as separate bladders draining into the cystic duct , or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic duct . Additionally , the gallbladder may fail to form at all . Gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist . These abnormalities are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic .""]","['In vertebrates, the gallbladder is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine.

what is the main mineral in lithium batteries,"[""Brande also described some pure salts of lithium , such as the chloride , and , estimating that lithia ( lithium oxide ) contained about 55 % metal , estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g / mol ( modern value ~ 6.94 g / mol ) . In 1855 , larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen . The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG , which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride .   The production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history . The first major application of lithium was in high - temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after . This use was supported by the fact that lithium - based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps , and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps . The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations , mostly in the US .   The demand for lithium increased dramatically during the Cold War with the production of nuclear fusion weapons . Both lithium - 6 and lithium - 7 produce tritium when irradiated by neutrons , and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself , as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of lithium deuteride . The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid 1980s . At the end , the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide . The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium - 6 by 75 % , which was enough to affect the measured atomic weight of lithium in many standardized chemicals , and even the atomic weight of lithium in some `` natural sources '' of lithium ion which had been `` contaminated '' by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities , which had found its way into ground water .   Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall - Héroult process . These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s . After the end of the nuclear arms race , the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices . In the mid 1990s , several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open - pit mining . Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price . For example , the US mines near Kings Mountain , North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century .   The development of lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007 . With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s , new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand .   Production ( edit )  Satellite images of the Salar del Hombre Muerto , Argentina ( left ) , and Uyuni , Bolivia ( right ) , salt flats that are rich in lithium . The lithium - rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds ( visible in the left image ) . World production trend of lithium  Lithium production has greatly increased since the end of World War II . The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals . The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55 % lithium chloride and 45 % potassium chloride at about 450 ° C ."", ""Under standard conditions , it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element . Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable , and is stored in mineral oil . When cut open , it exhibits a metallic luster , but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . It never occurs freely in nature , but only in ( usually ionic ) compounds , such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium . Due to its solubility as an ion , it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines . Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride .   The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability , since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides . Because of its relative nuclear instability , lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light : it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common . For related reasons , lithium has important uses in nuclear physics . The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man - made nuclear reaction , and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons .   Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications , including heat - resistant glass and ceramics , lithium grease lubricants , flux additives for iron , steel and aluminium production , lithium batteries , and lithium - ion batteries . These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production .   Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts ; its functions are uncertain . Lithium salts have proven to be useful as a mood - stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans .

Because of this , lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element , though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals . Lithium 's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its nucleus ( the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital , much lower in energy , and do not participate in chemical bonds ) .   Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife ."", 'Extraction ( edit )   Lithium salts are extracted from water in mineral springs , brine pools , and brine deposits .   Lithium is present in seawater , but commercially viable methods of extraction have yet to be developed .   Another potential source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells , which are carried to the surface . Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field ; the lithium is separated by simple filtration . The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already - operating well ; net environmental impacts may thus be positive .   Uses ( edit )  Estimates of global lithium uses in 2015 Ceramics and glass ( 32 % ) Batteries ( 35 % ) Lubricating greases ( 9 % ) Continuous casting ( 5 % ) Air treatment ( 5 % ) Polymers ( 4 % ) Primary aluminum production ( 1 % ) Pharmaceuticals ( < 1 % ) Other ( 9 % )  Ceramics and glass ( edit )   Lithium oxide is widely used as a flux for processing silica , reducing the melting point and viscosity of the material and leading to glazes with improved physical properties including low coefficients of thermal expansion . Worldwide , this is one of the largest use for lithium compounds . Glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware . Lithium carbonate ( Li CO ) is generally used in this application because it converts to the oxide upon heating .   Electrical and electronics ( edit )   Late in the 20th century , lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes , because of its high electrode potential . Because of its low atomic mass , it has a high charge - and power - to - weight ratio . A typical lithium - ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell , compared with 2.1 volts for lead - acid or 1.5 volts for zinc - carbon cells . Lithium - ion batteries , which are rechargeable and have a high energy density , should not be confused with lithium batteries , which are disposable ( primary ) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode . Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium - ion polymer battery , lithium iron phosphate battery , and the nanowire battery .   Lubricating greases ( edit )  Main article : Lithium grease  The third most common use of lithium is in greases . Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and , when heated with a fat , produces a soap made of lithium stearate . Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils , and it is used to manufacture all - purpose , high - temperature lubricating greases .   Metallurgy ( edit )   Lithium ( e.g. as lithium carbonate ) is used as an additive to continuous casting mould flux slags where it increases fluidity , a use which accounts for 5 % of global lithium use ( 2011 ) . Lithium compounds are also used as additives ( fluxes ) to foundry sand for iron casting to reduce veining .   Lithium ( as lithium fluoride ) is used as an additive to aluminium smelters ( Hall -- Héroult process ) , reducing melting temperature and increasing electrical resistance , a use which accounts for 3 % of production ( 2011 ) .   When used as a flux for welding or soldering , metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities . Alloys of the metal with aluminium , cadmium , copper and manganese are used to make high - performance aircraft parts ( see also Lithium - aluminium alloys ) .   Silicon nano - welding ( edit )   Lithium has been found effective in assisting the perfection of silicon nano - welds in electronic components for electric batteries and other devices .']","['Late in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential.

right to property according to the constitution of india is a,"[""Fundamental rights not sacrosanct ( edit )   While deciding the Golaknath case in February 1967 , Supreme Court ruled that the Parliament has no power to curtail the fundamental rights . They were made permanent and sacrosanct reversing the Supreme Court 's earlier decision which had upheld Parliament 's power to amend all parts of the Constitution , including Part III related to Fundamental Rights . Up till the 24th constitutional amendment in 1971 , the fundamental rights given to the people were permanent and can not be repealed or diluted by the Parliament . 24th constitutional amendment introduced a new Article 13 ( 4 ) enabling Parliament to legislate on the subjects of Part III of the constitution using its constituent powers per Article 368 ( 1 ) . In the year 1973 , the 13 member constitutional bench of supreme court also upheld with majority the validity of 24th constitutional amendment . However it ruled that Basic structure of the constitution which is built on the basic foundation representing the dignity and freedom of the individual , can not be altered . This is of supreme importance and can not be destroyed by any form of amendment to the constitution . Many constitutional amendments to Part III of the constitution were made deleting or adding or diluting the fundamental rights before the judgement of Golaknath case ( Constitutional amendments 1 , 4 , 7 and 16 ) and after the validity of 24th constitutional amendment is upheld by the Supreme Court ( Constitutional amendments 25 , 42 , 44 , 50 , 77 , 81 , 85 , 86 , 93 and 97 ) .   Validity of Article 31B ( edit )   Articles 31A and Article 31B are added by First constitutional amendment in 1951 . Article 31B says that any acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule of the constitution by the Parliament can override the fundamental rights and such laws can not be repealed or made void by the judiciary on the grounds of violating fundamental rights . Thus fundamental rights given in Part III are not equally applicable in each state / region and can be made different by making additions / deletions to Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments . In 2007 , Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review for the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule . Apex court also stated it shall examine laws included in the Ninth Schedule after 1973 for any incompatibility with the basic structure doctrine .   Amendment to Article 31C ( edit )   Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment , had changed Article 31C of the constitution to accord precedence to the Directive Principles ( earlier applicable only to clauses b & c of Article 39 ) over the fundamental rights of individuals . In Minerva Mills v. Union of India case , supreme court ruled that the amendment to the Article 31C is not valid and ultra vires .   Right to property ( edit )   The Constitution originally provided for the right to property under Articles 19 and 31 . Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire , hold and dispose of property . Article 31 provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law . '' It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes .   The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times . The Forty - Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights A new provision , Article 300 - A , was added to the constitution , which provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law '' . Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property , there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation ."", ""Thus fundamental rights given in Part III are not equally applicable in each state / region and can be made different by making additions / deletions to Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments .

The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32 . Thus , the right to property is no longer a fundamental right , though it is still a constitutional right . If the government appears to have acted unfairly , the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens .   The liberalisation of the economy and the government 's initiative to set up special economic zones has led to many protests by farmers and have led to calls for the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property . The Supreme Court has sent a notice to the government questioning why the right should not be brought back but in 2010 the court rejected the PIL   Right to education ( edit )   The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the fundamental rights in 2002 under the Eighty - Sixth Amendment of 2002 . However this right was brought in to implementation after eight years in 2010 . Article 21A -- On 2 April 2010 , India joined a group of few countries in the world , with a historic law making education a fundamental right of every child coming into force . Making elementary education an entitlement for children in the 6 -- 14 age group , the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act will directly benefit children who do not go to school at present . This act provides for appointment of teachers with the requisite entry and academic qualifications .   The former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh announced the operationalisation of the Act . Children , who had either dropped out of schools or never been to any educational institution , will get elementary education as it will be binding on the part of the local and State governments to ensure that all children in the 6 -- 14 age group get schooling . As per the Act , private educational institutions should reserve 25 per cent seats for children from the weaker sections of society . The Centre and the States have agreed to share the financial burden in the ratio of 55 : 45 , while the Finance Commission has given Rs."", ""Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws , subject to discretion of the judiciary . The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality . These rights universally apply to all citizens , irrespective of race , place of birth , religion , caste or gender . Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid and their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process . However , in case of fundamental rights violation , Supreme court of India can be approached directly for ultimate justice per Article 32 . The Rights have their origins in many sources , including England 's Bill of Rights , the United States Bill of Rights and France 's Declaration of the Rights of Man .   The six fundamental rights recognised by the Indian constitution are the right to equality , right to freedom , right against exploitation , right to freedom of religion , cultural and educational rights , right to constitutional remedies and right to privacy . The right to equality includes equality before law , prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion , race , caste , gender or place of birth , and equality of opportunity in matters of employment , abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles . The right to freedom includes freedom of speech and expression , assembly , association or union or cooperatives , movement , residence , and right to practice any profession or occupation , right to life and liberty , protection in respect to conviction in offences and protection against arrest and detention in certain cases . The right against exploitation prohibits all forms of forced labour , child labour and trafficking of human beings . The right to freedom of religion includes freedom of conscience and free profession , practice , and propagation of religion , freedom to manage religious affairs , freedom from certain taxes and freedom from religious instructions in certain educational institutes . Cultural and educational rights preserve the right of any section of citizens to conserve their culture , language or script , and right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice . The right to constitutional remedies is present for enforcement of Fundamental Rights . The right to privacy is an intrinsic part of Article 21 that protects life and liberty of the citizens .   Fundamental rights for Indians have also been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices . Specifically , they have also been used to abolish untouchability and thus prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion , race , caste , sex , or place of birth . They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour ( a crime ) . They also protect cultural and educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions . They are covered in Part III ( Articles 12 to 35 ) of Indian constitution .

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander - in - chief of the United States Armed Forces .   In contemporary times , the president is looked upon as the world 's most powerful political figure and as the leader of the only current global superpower . The role includes responsibility for the world 's most expensive military that has the second largest nuclear arsenal . The president also leads the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP . The president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power .   Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government . It vests the executive power of the United States in the president . The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law , alongside the responsibility of appointing federal executive , diplomatic , regulatory and judicial officers , and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the Senate . The president is further empowered to grant federal pardons and reprieves , and to convene and adjourn either or both houses of Congress under extraordinary circumstances . The president directs the foreign and domestic policies of the United States , and takes an active role in promoting his policy priorities to members of Congress . In addition , as part of the system of checks and balances , Article One of the United States Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation . Since the office of president was established in 1789 , its power has grown substantially , as has the power of the federal government as a whole .   Through the Electoral College , the registered voters indirectly elect the president and vice president to a four - year term . This is the only federal election in the United States which is not decided by popular vote . Nine vice presidents became president by virtue of a president 's intra-term death or resignation .   The Twenty - second Amendment precludes any United States citizen from being elected president for a third term . It also prohibits a person from being elected to the presidency more than once if that person previously had served as president , or acting president , for more than two years of another person 's term as president .

what is the use of adobe flash cs3 professional,"[""It allows developers to build a single application against the OpenFL APIs , and simultaneously target multiple platforms including Flash / AIR , HTML5 , Windows , Android , Tizen , Neko , BlackBerry and webOS . OpenFL mirrors the Flash API for graphical operations . OpenFL applications are written in Haxe , a modern multi-platform programming language .   More than 500 video games have been developed with OpenFL , including the BAFTA - award - winning game Papers , Please , Rymdkapsel , Lightbot and Madden NFL Mobile .   HTML5 ( edit )  Main article : Comparison of HTML5 and Flash  HTML5 is often cited as an alternative to Adobe Flash technology usage on web pages . Adobe released a tool that converts Flash to HTML5 , and in June 2011 , Google released an experimental tool that does the same . In January 2015 , YouTube defaulted to HTML5 players to better support more devices .   Flash to HTML5 ( edit )   The following tools allow running Flash content in web browsers using HTML5 :    Adobe Edge Animate was designed to produce HTML5 animations directly .   Adobe Animate now allows Flash animations to be published into HTML5 content directly .   Google Swiffy - A web - based tool developed by Google that converts SWF files into HTML5 , using SVG for graphics and JavaScript for animation   Mozilla Shumway , a Flash virtual machine written in JavaScript .   CreateJS is library that while available separately was also adopted by Adobe as a replacement for Wallaby in CS6 . Unlike Wallaby , which was a standalone program , the `` Toolkit for CreateJS '' only works as a plug - in inside Flash Professional ; it generates output for the HTML5 canvas , animated with JavaScript . Around December 2013 , the toolkit was integrated directly into Flash Professional CC .    Criticisms ( edit )   Mobile support ( edit )   Websites built with Adobe Flash will not function on most modern mobile devices running Google Android or iOS ( iPhone , iPad ) . The only alternative is using HTML5 and responsive web design to build websites that support both desktop and mobile devices .   However , Flash is still used to build mobile games using Adobe AIR . Such games will not work in mobile web browsers , but must be installed via the appropriate app store .   Vendor dependence ( edit )  See also : Vendor lock - in  The reliance on Adobe for decoding Flash makes its use on the World Wide Web a concern -- the completeness of its public specifications are debated , and no complete implementation of Flash is publicly available in source code form with a license that permits reuse . Generally , public specifications are what makes a format re-implementable ( see future proofing data storage ) , and reusable codebases can be ported to new platforms without the endorsement of the format creator .   Adobe 's restrictions on the use of the SWF / FLV specifications were lifted in February 2009 ( see Adobe 's Open Screen Project ) . However , despite efforts of projects like Gnash , Swfdec and Lightspark , a complete free Flash player is yet to be seen , as of September 2011 . For example , Gnash can not use SWF v10 yet . Notably , Gnash was listed on the Free Software Foundation 's high priority list , from at least 2007 , to its overdue removal in January 2017 .   Notable advocates of free software , open standards , and the World Wide Web have warned against the use of Flash :   The founder of Mozilla Europe , Tristan Nitot , stated in 2008 :   Companies building websites should beware of proprietary rich - media technologies like Adobe 's Flash and Microsoft 's Silverlight .

Behind the optic foramen the anterior clinoid process is directed backward and medialward and gives attachment to the tentorium cerebelli .   Behind the tuberculum sellæ is a deep depression , the sella turcica , containing the fossa hypophyseos , which lodges the hypophysis , and presents on its anterior wall the middle clinoid processes .   The sella turcica is bounded posteriorly by a quadrilateral plate of bone , the dorsum sellae , the upper angles of which are surmounted by the posterior clinoid processes : these afford attachment to the tentorium cerebelli , and below each is a notch for the abducent nerve .   On either side of the sella turcica is the carotid groove , which is broad , shallow , and curved somewhat like the italic letter f .   It begins behind at the foramen lacerum , and ends on the medial side of the anterior clinoid process , where it is sometimes converted into a foramen ( carotico - clinoid ) by the union of the anterior with the middle clinoid process ; posteriorly , it is bounded laterally by the lingula .

This groove lodges the cavernous sinus and the internal carotid artery , the latter being surrounded by a plexus of sympathetic nerves .   Lateral parts ( edit )   The lateral parts of the middle fossa are of considerable depth , and support the temporal lobes of the brain .   They are marked by depressions for the brain convolutions and traversed by furrows for the anterior and posterior branches of the middle meningeal vessels .   These furrows begin near the foramen spinosum , and the anterior runs forward and upward to the sphenoidal angle of the parietal , where it is sometimes converted into a bony canal ; the posterior runs lateralward and backward across the temporal squama and passes on to the parietal near the middle of its lower border .   The following apertures are also to be seen .   In front is the superior orbital fissure , bounded above by the small wing , below , by the great wing , and medially , by the body of the sphenoid ; it is usually completed laterally by the orbital plate of the frontal bone .   It transmits to the orbital cavity the oculomotor , the trochlear , the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal , and the abducent nerves , some filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic , and the orbital branch of the middle meningeal artery ; and from the orbital cavity a recurrent branch from the lacrimal artery to the dura mater , and the ophthalmic veins .   Behind the medial end of the superior orbital fissure is the foramen rotundum , for the passage of the maxillary nerve .   Behind and lateral to the foramen rotundum is the foramen ovale , which transmits the mandibular nerve , the accessory meningeal artery , and the lesser superficial petrosal nerve .   Medial to the foramen ovale is the foramen Vesalii , which varies in size in different individuals , and is often absent ; when present , it opens below at the lateral side of the scaphoid fossa , and transmits a small vein .   Lateral to the foramen ovale is the foramen spinosum , for the passage of the middle meningeal vessels , and a recurrent branch from the mandibular nerve .   Medial to the foramen ovale is the foramen lacerum ; in the fresh state the lower part of this aperture is filled up by a layer of fibrocartilage , while its upper and inner parts transmit the internal carotid artery surrounded by a plexus of sympathetic nerves .', ""The nerve of the pterygoid canal and a meningeal branch from the ascending pharyngeal artery pierce the layer of fibrocartilage .   On the anterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone are seen the eminence caused by the projection of the superior semicircular canal ; in front of and a little lateral to this a depression corresponding to the roof of the tympanic cavity ; the groove leading to the hiatus of the facial canal , for the transmission of the greater superficial petrosal nerve and the petrosal branch of the middle meningeal artery ; beneath it , the smaller groove , for the passage of the lesser superficial petrosal nerve ; and , near the apex of the bone , the depression for the semilunar ganglion and the orifice of the carotid canal .

Controversy   The Outsiders was a controversial book at the time of its publication ; it is still currently challenged and debated . It was ranked # 38 on the American Library Association 's Top 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990 -- 1999 . This book has been banned from some schools and libraries because of the portrayal of gang violence , underage smoking and drinking , strong language / slang , and family dysfunction .

As hops are a climbing plant , they are trained to grow up trellises made from strings or wires that support the plants and allow them significantly greater growth with the same sunlight profile . In this way , energy that would have been required to build structural cells is also freed for crop growth .   The hop plant 's reproduction method is that male and female flowers develop on separate plants , although occasionally a fertile individual will develop which contains both male and female flowers . Because pollinated seeds are undesirable for brewing beer , only female plants are grown in hop fields , thus preventing pollination . Female plants are propagated vegetatively , and male plants are culled if plants are grown from seeds .   Hop plants are planted in rows about 2 to 2.5 metres ( 7 to 8 ft ) apart . Each spring , the roots send forth new bines that are started up strings from the ground to an overhead trellis . The cones grow high on the bine , and in the past , these cones were picked by hand . Harvesting of hops became much more efficient with the invention of the mechanical hops separator , patented by Emil Clemens Horst in 1909 .   Harvest comes near the end of summer when the bines are pulled down and the flowers are taken to a hop house or oast house for drying . Hop houses are two - story buildings , of which the upper story has a slatted floor covered with burlap . Here the flowers are poured out and raked even . A heating unit on the lower floor is used to dry the hops . When dry , the hops are moved to a press , a sturdy box with a plunger . Two long pieces of burlap are laid into the hop press at right angles , the hops are poured in and compressed into bales ."", ""In Germany , using hops was also a religious and political choice in the early 16th century . There was no tax on hops to be paid on the Catholic church , unlike on gruit , for which the Protestant preferred hopped beer .   Hops used in England were imported from France , Holland and Germany with import duty paid for those ; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England ( Kent ) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers . Therefore , in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words ( see oast house ) .

what's the dog's name on tom and jerry,"[""He is sometimes seen as Jerry 's nephew , but occasionally referred to as an orphan . In many cartoons , Nibbles is seen eating a lot ( he is always hungry ) . In his first animated appearance , he was left on Jerry 's doorstep , abandoned by his parents . Tom enjoys chasing Nibbles much as he does with Jerry .   Though the character was created under the name Tuffy for the comics in 1942 , his early animated appearances ( from 1945 ) gave him the name Nibbles . From the 1950s , the mouse was called Tuffy on - screen as well . In Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring , the name Nibbles was used again -- and the character was depicted as a pet - store mouse whom Jerry does n't know .   In the Mouseketeer shorts , Nibbles speaks in French and English . He also is not Jerry 's nephew ; rather , he is the son of François Mouse -- who does not make an appearance , but his name was given in two letters in the short Touché , Pussy Cat !   Nibbles is often mistaken for a girl due to the extaordinarily high pitched voice . He was voiced by Tara Strong in Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring , Kath Soucie from 2010 , onwards , and Nancy Cartwright in War of the Whiskers .   Quacker ( edit )  Quacker at the end of That 's My Mommy  Another recurring character in the series was Little Quacker the duckling , who was later adapted into the Hanna - Barbera character Yakky Doodle . He appears in Little Quacker , The Duck Doctor , Just Ducky , Downhearted Duckling , Southbound Duckling , That 's My Mommy , Happy Go Ducky , and The Vanishing Duck . Quacker talks a lot compared to Tom and Jerry . His voice is a ' duck voice ' similar to Disney 's Donald Duck . In many shorts , he is the only one who speaks . He 's very trusting , even trusting Tom in many situations in which Tom wishes to eat him . He 's a friend of Jerry , but unlike Jerry harbors no hard feelings towards Tom . He appeared in The Tom and Jerry Show episode `` The Lost Duckling . '' He also got his own series of shorts on The Yogi Bear Show ( renamed Yakky Doodle ) after guesting in several Hanna - Barbera TV shows . Quacker was then used as a template for the ' Hard Luck Duck ' character starring in the titular character 's short from the What A Cartoon ! series . His What A Cartoon ! counterpart Hard Luck Duck was voiced by Russi Taylor .   Quacker was voiced by Red Coffey in the classic shorts , and Charlie Adler in Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers , along with Jerry . He was named `` Duckling '' in that game .   In Tom and Jerry Show , Quacker 's `` duck voice '' is provided by Sam Kwasman .   In three cartoons Quacker gets separated from his mother at birth , only to reunite with her later in two of them ( Little Quacker and Just Ducky ) . In That 's My Mommy however , he is adopted by Tom . In Little Quacker , Quacker 's father , Henry makes an appearance . Because his birth is shown differently in different cartoons , he may have siblings as seen in Just Ducky and Happy Go Ducky .   Quacker gets a girlfriend in Downhearted Duckling .

He is usually but not always , portrayed as living a comfortable , or even pampered life , while Jerry ( named `` Jinx '' in his debut appearance ) is a small , brown , house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom . Despite being very energetic , determined and much larger , Tom is no match for Jerry 's wits . Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size , approximately the equivalent of Tom 's , lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts . Although cats typically chase mice to consume them , it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to consume Jerry . Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry , sometimes in revenge , and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry . By the final `` fade - out '' of each cartoon , Jerry usually emerges triumphant , while Tom is shown as the loser .   However , other results may be reached . On rare occasions , Tom triumphs , usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or when he pushes Tom a little too far . In The Million Dollar Cat Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal , `` including a mouse ; '' he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates . In Timid Tabby Tom 's look - alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge . Occasionally and usually ironically , they both lose , usually when Jerry 's final trap or attack on Tom backfires or Jerry overlooks something . In Chuck Jones ' Filet Meow , Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish , but finds himself entirely intimidated as well . Finally , they occasionally end up being friends , although within this set of stories , there is often a last minute event that ruins the truce . One story that has friendly ending is Snowbody Loves Me .   Both characters display sadistic tendencies , in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other , although it is often in response to a triggering event . However , when one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party , the other will develop a conscience and save him . Occasionally , they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks . Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty , and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it , usually against a third party who manages to torture and humiliate them both . Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens , or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary . This is the case in Posse Cat , when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner , but Tom then reneges . Other times however , Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved .   Tom changes his love interest many times . The first love interest is Toots who appears in Puss n ' Toots , and calls him `` Tommy '' in The Mouse Comes to Dinner ."", ""Mammy two Shoes ( edit )  Mammy Two Shoes in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , in which her full face was shown for the first time . Main article : Mammy Two Shoes  From the beginning , Tom also has to deal with Mammy Two Shoes ( voiced by Lillian Randolph ) , an African - American domestic housemaid based on Hattie McDaniel . In the earliest shorts , Mammy is depicted as the maid taking care of the often opulent home in which Tom and Jerry reside . Later Tom and Jerry shorts are set in what appears to be Mammy 's own house . Her face is never seen ( with the exception of 1950s Saturday Evening Puss , in which her face is very briefly seen as she runs towards the camera ) , and she usually wallops the cat ( whom she usually addresses as `` Thomas '' ) with a broom when he misbehaves . When Mammy was not present , other humans would sometimes be seen , usually from the neck down as well . Mammy would appear in many cartoons until 1952 's Push - Button Kitty ; Mammy 's character was retired after that year following McDaniel 's death . Later cartoons would instead show Tom and Jerry living with a 1950s suburban couple . Soon after , virtually all humans in the series had visible faces .

where was the music video what ifs filmed,"[""The song is about a couple where the question `` what if '' is asked repeatedly about what would happen in their relationship . It features a duet with Lauren Alaina , a school friend from Lakeview - Fort Oglethorpe High School when he was living in Fort Oglethorpe , Georgia . According to Brown , the song was initially not intended to be a duet , he said : `` Once we decided on adding a woman to `` What Ifs , '' I knew that I wanted Lauren to sing it , and , of course , she killed it . '' According to Brown , another song was going to be used in the album , however , he was asked so much about `` What Ifs '' on social media that it was then decided that the song should be included in the album .   Composition ( edit )   The song is in the key of G minor with a moderately fast tempo of approximately 126 beats per minute . It follows the chord progression Gm - B ♭ - F. Brown 's vocals range from F - B ♭ .   Commercial performance ( edit )   The song sold 6,000 downloads in the US the week the album was released on December 2 , 2016 , allowing it to chart at number 37 on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart . The song first entered the US Billboard Country Airplay chart for the week of March 4 , 2017 at number 60 . It reached No. 1 on Hot Country Songs in October 2017 , ending the record breaking 34 - week reign of Sam Hunt 's `` Body Like a Back Road '' . The song is the first No. 1 on the chart for both Brown and Alaina . The following week , for charts dated October 28 , 2017 , `` What Ifs '' stayed at number one , as well as topping the Country Airplay and Country Streaming Songs charts . Together with the release of the deluxe edition of the album which also reached number on Top Country Albums , and another number one for a new track `` Heaven '' on digital sales , Brown became the first artist to have simultaneous number ones on all five main country charts .

in which regions are most of africa petroleum and natural gas found,"[""Nearly all of the country 's primary reserves are concentrated in and around the delta of the Niger River , but off - shore rigs are also prominent in the well - endowed coastal region . Nigeria is one of the few major oil - producing nations still capable of increasing its oil output . Unlike most of the other OPEC countries , Nigeria is not projected to exceed peak production until at least 2009 . The reason for Nigeria 's relative unproductivity is primarily OPEC regulations on production to regulate prices on the international market . More recently , production has been disrupted intermittently by the protests of the Niger Delta 's inhabitants , who feel they are being exploited .   Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources . The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or `` South - south '' region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields . Most of Nigeria 's oil fields are small and scattered , and as of 1990 , these small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1 % of all Nigerian production . This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9 % of Nigeria 's petroleum at that time .   As a result of the numerous small fields , an extensive and well - developed pipeline network has been engineered to transport the crude oil . Also because of the lack of highly productive fields , money from the jointly operated ( with the federal government ) companies is constantly directed towards petroleum exploration and production .   Nigeria 's petroleum is classified mostly as `` light '' and `` sweet '' , as the oil is largely free of sulphur . Nigeria is the largest producer of sweet oil in OPEC . This sweet oil is similar in composition to petroleum extracted from the North Sea . This crude oil is known as `` Bonny light '' . Names of other Nigerian crudes , all of which are named according to export terminal , are Qua Ibo , Escravos blend , Brass River , Forcados , and Pennington Anfan .   As recently as 2010 , Nigeria provided about 10 % of overall U.S. oil imports and ranked as the fifth - largest source for oil imports in the U.S. However , Nigeria ceased exports to the US in July 2014 because of the impact of shale production in America ; India is now the largest consumer of Nigerian oil .   There are six petroleum exportation terminals in the country . Shell owns two , while Mobil , Chevron , Texaco , and Agip own one each . Shell also owns the Forcados Terminal , which is capable of storing 13 million barrels ( 2,100,000 m ) of crude oil in conjunction with the nearby Bonny Terminal . Mobil operates primarily out of the Qua Iboe Terminal in Akwa Ibom State , while Chevron owns the Escravos Terminal located in Delta State and has a storage capacity of 3.6 million barrels ( 570,000 m ) . Agip operates the Brass Terminal in Brass , a town 113 kilometres ( 70 miles ) southwest of Port Harcourt and has a storage capacity of 3,558,000 barrels ( 565,700 m ) . Texaco operates the Pennington Terminal .   Offshore ( edit )   Oil companies in Africa investigate offshore production as an alternative area of production . Deepwater production mainly involves underwater drilling that exists 400 metres ( 1,300 ft ) or more below the surface of the water . By expanding to deep water drilling the possible sources for finding new oil reserves is expanded . Through the introduction of deep water drilling 50 % more oil is extracted than before the new forms of retrieving the oil .

In Nigeria , the deepwater sector still has a large avenue to expand and develop . The Agbami oilfields hit full production in 2005 , at 250,000 barrels ( 40,000 m ) a day . Operated by Chevron 's Star Deep and a company called Famfa , Agbami is only one off - shore concession ; there are others named Akpo , Bonga and Erha . The amount of oil extracted from Nigeria was expected to expand from 15,000 barrels per day ( 2,400 m / d ) in 2003 to 1.27 million barrels per day ( 202,000 m / d ) in 2010 . Deepwater drilling for oil is especially attractive to oil companies because the Nigerian government has very little share in these activities and it is more difficult for the government to regulate the offshore activities of the companies .   The deepwater extraction plants are less disturbed by local militant attacks , seizures due to civil conflicts , and sabotage . These advancements offer more resources and alternatives to extract the oil from the Niger Delta , with less exposure to conflict than the operations on land . An open - air market for illegal crude oil operates off the Niger Delta , called the Togo Triangle .   Natural gas ( edit )   Natural gas reserves are well over 5,300 km ( 187 × 10 ^ cu ft ) , the gas reserves are three times as substantial as the crude oil reserves . The biggest natural gas initiative is the Nigerian Liquified Natural Gas Company , which is operated jointly by several companies and the state . It began exploration and production in 1999 . Chevron is also attempting to create the Escravos Gas Utilization project which will be capable of producing 4,500,000 m ( 160 × 10 ^ cu ft ) per day . gas reserves . In 2008 , the government prepared a Gas Master Plan that was intended to promote natural gas production and encourage the supply of natural gas to domestic power stations so as to help alleviate the country 's electricity shortages .""]","['Nigeria is the largest oil and gas producer in Africa.

in which sea pearl is found in india,"[""It also records that eight varieties of pearls accompanied Prince Vijaya 's embassy to the Pandyan king as well as king Devanampiya Tissa 's embassy to Emperor Ashoka . Pliny the Elder ( 23 -- 79AD ) praised the pearl fishery of the Gulf as most productive in the world .   For thousands of years , seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf , the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar . Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions . Starting in the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC -- 220 AD ) , the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea . In the 14th - century Arabian Sea , the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver 's waist .  Catching of pearls , Bern Physiologus ( 9th century )  When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Western Hemisphere , they discovered that around the islands of Cubagua and Margarita , some 200 km north of the Venezuelan coast , was an extensive pearl bed ( a bed of pearl oysters ) . One discovered and named pearl , La Peregrina pearl , was offered to the Spanish queen . According to Garcilasso de la Vega , who says that he saw La Peregrina at Seville in 1607 , this was found at Panama in 1560 by a slave worker who was rewarded with his liberty , and his owner with the office of alcalde of Panama .   Margarita pearls are extremely difficult to find today and are known for their unique yellowish color . The most famous Margarita necklace that anyone can see today is the one that then Venezuelan President Romulo Betancourt gave to Jacqueline Kennedy when she and her husband , President John F. Kennedy paid an official visit to Venezuela .   Before the beginning of the 20th century , pearl hunting was the most common way of harvesting pearls . Divers manually pulled oysters from ocean floors and river bottoms and checked them individually for pearls . Not all mussels and oysters produce pearls . In a haul of three tons , only three or four oysters will produce perfect pearls .  British isles ( edit )  Pearls were one of the attractions which drew Julius Caesar to Britain . They are , for the most part , freshwater pearls from mussels . Pearling was banned in the U.K. in 1998 due to the endangered status of river mussels . Discovery and publicity about the sale for a substantial sum of the Abernethy pearl in the River Tay had resulted in heavy exploitation of mussel colonies during the 1970s and 80s by weekend warriors . When it was permitted it was carried on mainly by Scottish Travellers who found pearls varied from river to river with the River Oykel in the Highlands being noted for the finest rose - pink pearls . There are two firms in Scotland that are licensed to sell pre-1998 freshwater pearls .   Pearl farming ( edit )  A pearl being extracted from an akoya pearl oyster . See also : Oyster farming  Today , the cultured pearls on the market can be divided into two categories . The first category covers the beaded cultured pearls , including Akoya , South Sea and Tahiti . These pearls are gonad grown , and usually one pearl is grown at a time . This limits the number of pearls at a harvest period . The pearls are usually harvested after one year for akoya , 2 -- 4 years for Tahitian and South Sea , and 2 -- 7 years for freshwater ."", ""A beadless cultured pearl ( whether of freshwater or saltwater origin ) may show growth rings , but also a complex central cavity , witness of the first precipitation of the young pearl sac .   Imitation pearls ( edit )  Main article : Imitation pearl  Some imitation pearls ( also called shell pearls ) are simply made of mother - of - pearl , coral or conch shell , while others are made from glass and are coated with a solution containing fish scales called essence d'Orient . Although imitation pearls look the part , they do not have the same weight or smoothness as real pearls , and their luster will also dim greatly .   Gemological Identification ( edit )   A well - equipped gem testing laboratory can distinguish natural pearls from cultured pearls by using gemological X-ray equipment to examine the center of a pearl . With X-rays it is possible to see the growth rings of the pearl , where the layers of calcium carbonate are separated by thin layers of conchiolin . The differentiation of natural pearls from non-beaded cultured pearls can be very difficult without the use of this X-ray technique .   Natural and cultured pearls can be distinguished from imitation pearls using a microscope . Another method of testing for imitations is to rub two pearls against each other . Imitation pearls are completely smooth , but natural and cultured pearls are composed of nacre platelets , making both feel slightly gritty .   Value of a natural pearl ( edit )  Pearl tiara of Empress Eugénie ( 1853 ) featuring 212 natural pearls , Louvre , Paris .  Fine quality natural pearls are very rare jewels . Their values are determined similarly to those of other precious gems , according to size , shape , color , quality of surface , orient and luster .   Single natural pearls are often sold as collectors ' items , or set as centerpieces in unique jewelry . Very few matched strands of natural pearls exist , and those that do often sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars . ( In 1917 , jeweler Pierre Cartier purchased the Fifth Avenue mansion that is now the New York Cartier store in exchange for a matched double strand of natural pearls Cartier had been collecting for years ; at the time , it was valued at US $1 million . )   The introduction and advance of the cultured pearl hit the pearl industry hard . Pearl dealers publicly disputed the authenticity of these new cultured products , and left many consumers uneasy and confused about their much lower prices . Essentially , the controversy damaged the images of both natural and cultured pearls . By the 1950s , when a significant number of women in developed countries could afford their own cultured pearl necklace , natural pearls were reduced to a small , exclusive niche in the pearl industry .   Origin of a natural pearl ( edit )  Mary , Queen of Scots wearing a rope of black pearls  Previously , natural pearls were found in many parts of the world . Present day natural pearling is confined mostly to seas off Bahrain . Australia also has one of the world 's last remaining fleets of pearl diving ships . Australian pearl divers dive for south sea pearl oysters to be used in the cultured south sea pearl industry . The catch of pearl oysters is similar to the numbers of oysters taken during the natural pearl days . Hence significant numbers of natural pearls are still found in the Australian Indian Ocean waters from wild oysters . X-ray examination is required to positively verify natural pearls found today .   Types of cultured pearls ( edit )  A blister pearl , a half - sphere , formed flush against the shell of the pearl oyster .  Keshi pearls , although they often occur by chance , are not considered natural . They are a byproduct of the culturing process , and hence do not happen without human intervention . They are quite small , typically only a few millimeters ."", ""( In 1917 , jeweler Pierre Cartier purchased the Fifth Avenue mansion that is now the New York Cartier store in exchange for a matched double strand of natural pearls Cartier had been collecting for years ; at the time , it was valued at US $1 million . )   The introduction and advance of the cultured pearl hit the pearl industry hard . Pearl dealers publicly disputed the authenticity of these new cultured products , and left many consumers uneasy and confused about their much lower prices . Essentially , the controversy damaged the images of both natural and cultured pearls . By the 1950s , when a significant number of women in developed countries could afford their own cultured pearl necklace , natural pearls were reduced to a small , exclusive niche in the pearl industry .   Origin of a natural pearl ( edit )  Mary , Queen of Scots wearing a rope of black pearls  Previously , natural pearls were found in many parts of the world . Present day natural pearling is confined mostly to seas off Bahrain . Australia also has one of the world 's last remaining fleets of pearl diving ships . Australian pearl divers dive for south sea pearl oysters to be used in the cultured south sea pearl industry . The catch of pearl oysters is similar to the numbers of oysters taken during the natural pearl days . Hence significant numbers of natural pearls are still found in the Australian Indian Ocean waters from wild oysters . X-ray examination is required to positively verify natural pearls found today .   Types of cultured pearls ( edit )  A blister pearl , a half - sphere , formed flush against the shell of the pearl oyster .  Keshi pearls , although they often occur by chance , are not considered natural . They are a byproduct of the culturing process , and hence do not happen without human intervention . They are quite small , typically only a few millimeters . Keshi pearls are produced by many different types of marine mollusks and freshwater mussels in China . Keshi pearls are actually a mistake in the cultured pearl seeding process . In seeding the cultured pearl , a piece of mantle muscle from a sacrificed oyster is placed with a bead of mother of pearl within the oyster . If the piece of mantle should slip off the bead , a pearl forms of baroque shape about the mantle piece which is entirely nacre . Therefore , a Keshi pearl could be considered superior to cultured pearls with a mother of pearl bead center . In the cultured pearl industry , the resources used to create a mistaken all nacre baroque pearl is a drain on the production of round cultured pearls . Therefore , they are trying to improve culturing technique so that keshi pearls do not occur . All nacre pearls may one day be limited to natural found pearls . Today many `` keshi '' pearls are actually intentional , with post-harvest shells returned to the water to regenerate a pearl in the existing pearl sac .   Tahitian pearls , frequently referred to as black pearls , are highly valued because of their rarity ; the culturing process for them dictates a smaller volume output and they can never be mass - produced because , in common with most sea pearls , the oyster can only be nucleated with one pearl at a time , while freshwater mussels are capable of multiple pearl implants . Before the days of cultured pearls , black pearls were rare and highly valued for the simple reason that white pearl oysters rarely produced naturally black pearls , and black pearl oysters rarely produced any natural pearls at all .   Since the development of pearl culture technology , the black pearl oysters Pinctada margaritifera found in Tahiti and many other Pacific islands including the Cook Islands and Fiji are being extensively used for producing cultured pearls . The rarity of the black cultured pearl is now a `` comparative '' issue .""]","[""For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.[29][30][31] Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions.[30][31] Starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea.[citation needed] In the 14th-century Arabian Sea, the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver's waist.[citation needed]""]",Pearls in India are found in the Gulf of Mannar.,the Indian Ocean

where does kylo ren's name come from,"[""Abrams had previously told Entertainment Weekly that the character , `` came to the name Kylo Ren when he joined a group called the Knights of Ren . '' Robbie Collin of The Telegraph described Ren as `` a hot - headed , radicalised Dark Side jihadi , whose red lightsaber splutters and crackles as violently as his temper '' . Abrams noted , `` The lightsaber is something that he built himself , and is as dangerous and as fierce and as ragged as the character . '' The Telegraph also explains that Ren 's wild and erratic temper and `` angsty '' instability make him dangerous . Melissa Leon of The Daily Beast describes Ren 's use of the Force as `` formidable '' , citing his ability to stop a blaster shot mid-air , immobilize victims and probe their minds against their will .   Kasdan told Entertainment Weekly in August 2015 , `` I 've written four Star Wars movies now , and there 's never been a character quite like the one that Adam plays . I think you 're going to see something that 's brand new to the saga , '' noting that the character is `` full of emotion '' . Abrams explained , `` I think that what makes Ren so unique is that he is n't as fully formed as when we meet a character such as Darth Vader ... He is not your prototypical mustache - twirling bad guy . He is a little bit more complex than that . '' Driver said in December 2015 that , despite the visual similarities to Darth Vader , Ren is `` unlike any villain the franchise has seen before '' . He explained :   I feel there 's a recklessness about him that 's maybe not normally associated with the Dark Side . You normally think of order , and structure , and full commitment and no hesitation ... he 's just a little bit more unpolished . It 's in his costume , in his lightsaber -- how you kind of get the sense that it could just not work at any moment ; that it could just blow up . That 's kind of like a big metaphor for him .

Feature films ( edit )  The Force Awakens ( 2015 ) ( edit ) Main article : Star Wars : The Force Awakens  Kylo Ren first appears in The Force Awakens as the commander of the First Order , a sinister regime that has risen from the remains of the old Galactic Empire . After arriving at Jakku to retrieve a map containing the coordinates for the location of Luke Skywalker , Ren kills an old vicar known as Lor San Tekka and captures Resistance pilot Poe Dameron , who has also been sent to recover the map by General Leia Organa . Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his astromech droid , BB - 8 , with the map . Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper Finn , who later finds BB - 8 , and the scavenger Rey . Finn , Rey , and BB - 8 escape Jakku in the Millennium Falcon , and are soon intercepted by the ship 's former owner , Han Solo , and his co-pilot Chewbacca .   It is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia , and was once one of Luke 's Jedi pupils . He was drawn to the dark side of the Force by the First Order 's Supreme Leader Snoke . He then helped to destroy his uncle Luke 's new Jedi Academy . However , Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome this weakness from his grandfather Darth Vader , whose burnt helmet is in Ren 's possession ."", ""Title: Kylo Ren\r\nKylo Ren - wikipedia  Kylo Ren  Jump to : navigation , search `` Kylo '' redirects here .

Feature films ( edit )  The Force Awakens ( 2015 ) ( edit ) Main article : Star Wars : The Force Awakens  Kylo Ren first appears in The Force Awakens as the commander of the First Order , a sinister regime that has risen from the remains of the old Galactic Empire . After arriving at Jakku to retrieve a map containing the coordinates for the location of Luke Skywalker , Ren kills an old vicar known as Lor San Tekka and captures Resistance pilot Poe Dameron , who has also been sent to recover the map by General Leia Organa . Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his astromech droid , BB - 8 , with the map . Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper Finn , who later finds BB - 8 , and the scavenger Rey . Finn , Rey , and BB - 8 escape Jakku in the Millennium Falcon , and are soon intercepted by the ship 's former owner , Han Solo , and his co-pilot Chewbacca .   It is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia , and was once one of Luke 's Jedi pupils . He was drawn to the dark side of the Force by the First Order 's Supreme Leader Snoke . He then helped to destroy his uncle Luke 's new Jedi Academy . However , Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome this weakness from his grandfather Darth Vader , whose burnt helmet is in Ren 's possession . Arriving at the Maz Kanata castle , Ren captures Rey , who he senses has seen the map . While interrogating her with the Force , he realizes that she is strong with the Force herself , though unaware of it . Rey finds herself able to experience Ren 's emotions and confronts him on his fear that he will never be as powerful as Vader . She later uses the `` Jedi mind trick '' to compel her stormtrooper guard to let her escape . Han arrives at the First Order 's battle station , Starkiller Base , as part of the Resistance 's plan to destroy it .   After Han plants explosives to destroy the base , he confronts Ren , calling him by his real name , Ben , and implores him to abandon the dark side , warning him that Snoke will kill him once he accomplishes his goal to seize control of the galaxy . Ren refuses and kills his father , enraging Chewbacca , Han 's copilot , who fires , injuring Ren . As Finn and Rey flee the damaged base , a badly injured Ren follows and confronts them . Finn fights Ren with Luke 's recovered lightsaber , but Ren overpowers and severely wounds him . Rey then takes up the lightsaber and , using the Force , begins to overcome Ren , as well as striking him on the face with the lightsaber , leaving Ren with a scar on the right side of his face . Before the duel is finished , they are separated by a seismic fissure created by the collapsing base . Rey and the others escape as Snoke orders General Hux to evacuate the base and bring Ren to him to complete his training .  The last Jedi ( 2017 ) ( edit ) Main article : Star Wars : The Last Jedi  Ren 's inner conflict continues into The Last Jedi , specifically through his conversations with Rey , with whom he connects through the Force . Rey believes that his conflict will ultimately bring him back to the light side . Ren captures her and brings her before Snoke , who orders Ren to kill her .""]","['Abrams told Empire in August 2015, ""Kylo Ren is not a Sith.

As of 2016 , the 14 countries accounted for an estimated 44 percent of global oil production and 73 percent of the world 's `` proven '' oil reserves , giving OPEC a major influence on global oil prices that were previously determined by American - dominated multinational oil companies .   OPEC 's stated mission is `` to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets , in order to secure an efficient , economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers , a steady income to producers , and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum industry . '' The organization is also a significant provider of information about the international oil market . As of May 2017 , OPEC 's members are Algeria , Angola , Ecuador , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia ( the de facto leader ) , United Arab Emirates , and Venezuela , while Indonesia is a former member . Two - thirds of OPEC 's oil production and reserves are in its six Middle Eastern countries that surround the oil - rich Persian Gulf .   The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources , and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations . The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply . In the 1970s , restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC 's revenue and wealth , with long - lasting and far - reaching consequences for the global economy . In the 1980s , OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations ; and generally when the production targets are reduced , oil prices increase , most recently from the organization 's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply .   Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition , but whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law . In December 2014 , `` OPEC and the oil men '' ranked as # 3 on Lloyd 's list of `` the top 100 most influential people in the shipping industry '' . However , their influence on international trade is periodically challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources , and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC countries to exceed production ceilings and pursue conflicting self - interests .

Jeep has been a part of Chrysler since 1987 , when Chrysler acquired the Jeep brand , along with remaining assets , from its previous owner : American Motors Corporation ( AMC ) .   Jeep 's current product range consists solely of sport utility vehicles and off - road vehicles , but has also included pickup trucks in the past . Some of Jeep 's vehicles , such as the Grand Cherokee and the Wagoneer , reach into the luxury segment . Jeep sold 1.4 million SUVs globally in 2016 , up from 500,000 in 2008 , two - thirds of which in North America , and was Fiat - Chrysler 's best selling brand in the U.S. during the first half of 2017 . In the U.S. alone , over 2400 dealerships hold franchise rights to sell Jeep - branded vehicles , and if Jeep were spun off into a separate company , it is estimated to be worth between $22 and $33.5 billion -- slightly more than all of FCA ( US ) .   Prior to 1940 the term `` jeep '' had been used as U.S. Army slang for new recruits or vehicles , but the World War II `` jeep '' that went into production in 1941 specifically tied the name to this light military 4x4 , arguably making them the oldest four - wheel drive mass - production vehicles now known as SUVs . The Jeep became the primary light 4 - wheel - drive vehicle of the United States Army and the Allies during World War II , as well as the postwar period . The term became common worldwide in the wake of the war . Doug Stewart noted : `` The spartan , cramped , and unstintingly functional jeep became the ubiquitous World War II four - wheeled personification of Yankee ingenuity and cocky , can - do determination . ''   The Jeep marque has been headquartered in Toledo , Ohio , ever since Willys - Overland launched production of the first CJ or Civilian Jeep branded models there in 1945 . Its replacement , the conceptually consistent Jeep Wrangler series , remains in production since 1986 . With its solid axles and open top , the Wrangler has been called the Jeep model that is as central to the brand 's identity as the rear - engined 911 is to Porsche .   At least two Jeep models ( the CJ - 5 and the SJ Wagoneer ) enjoyed extraordinary three - decade production runs of a single body generation . Jeeps have since the war inspired a number of other light utility vehicles , such as the Land Rover .

In 1995 , he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL 's salary cap .

He was known for being a relatively poor tackler and he was not much of a factor in run support .   Sanders also occasionally lined up with his team 's offense . During the 1996 season , Sanders skipped the baseball season , concentrating on football , and attended the first NFL training camp of his career to better familiarize himself with the nuances of the wide receiver position . He became only the second two - way starter ( after the Cardinals ' Roy Green ) in the NFL since Chuck Bednarik for the first half of the season due .

what is the name of manchester united stadium,"[""^ Since 1997 this combination is primarily used in European and international competitions .    Grounds  Old Trafford after its expansion completed in 2006  Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road , close to the railway yard ; the original capacity was about 12,000 , but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League . Some expansion took place in 1887 , and in 1891 , Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands , each able to hold 1,000 spectators . Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road , the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893 . A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889 .   In June 1893 , after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners , Manchester Deans and Canons , who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground , secretary A.H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton . It initially had no stands , by the start of the 1893 -- 94 season , two had been built ; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the `` Bradford end '' . At the opposite end , the `` Clayton end '' , the ground had been `` built up , thousands thus being provided for '' . Newton Heath 's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893 , when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat - trick , Newton Heath 's only goals in a 3 -- 2 win . The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later . In October 1895 , before the visit of Manchester City , the club purchased a 2,000 - capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club , and put up another stand on the `` reserved side '' ( as distinct from the `` popular side '' ) . However , weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000 .   When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902 , club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club 's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham . Following financial investment , new club president John Henry Davies paid £ 500 for the erection of a new 1,000 - seat stand at Bank Street . Within four years , the stadium had cover on all four sides , as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators , some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand .   However , following Manchester United 's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later , it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ' ambition ; in February 1909 , six weeks before the club 's first FA Cup title , Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United , following the purchase of land for around £ 60,000 . Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £ 30,000 for construction ; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000 , though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000 . The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester . The stadium 's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939 , when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators ."", ""Title: Manchester United F.C.\r\nManchester United F.C. - Wikipedia  Manchester United F.C.

Manchester United have won a record 20 League titles , 12 FA Cups , 5 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields . The club has also won three UEFA Champions Leagues , one UEFA Europa League , one UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup , one UEFA Super Cup , one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup . In 1998 -- 99 , the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League , the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League . In 2016 -- 17 , by winning the UEFA Europa League , they became one of five clubs to have won all three main UEFA club competitions . In addition , they became the only professional English club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team that is organised by a national or international governing body .   The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players . In 1968 , under the management of Matt Busby , Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup . Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies as manager , including 13 Premier League titles , 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues , between 1986 and 2013 , when he announced his retirement . José Mourinho is the club 's current manager , having been appointed on 27 May 2016 .   Manchester United was the highest - earning football club in the world for 2016 -- 17 , with an annual revenue of € 676.3 million , and the world 's most valuable football club in 2017 , valued at £ 2.86 billion . As of June 2015 , it is the world 's most valuable football brand , estimated to be worth $1.2 billion . After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991 , the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £ 800 million , after which the company was taken private again , before going public once more in August 2012 , when they made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange . Manchester United is one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world , and has its strongest rivalries with Liverpool , Manchester City and Leeds United ."", ""Morgan , Steve ( March 2010 ) .

She is hesitant to contribute but agrees to see a private screening of the show .   Encouraged by her grandfather , Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance , but becomes his stage hand instead . When one of the acts quits , and another is injured , Meena is added as an act . The performers ' individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals : Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter , after having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray . After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend and evicting them from her apartment , Ash is devastated and can no longer sing her assigned song , Carly Rae Jepsen 's `` Call Me Maybe . '' Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of a getaway car in a heist and making the practices . When he tries to do both , he does not show up for the planned pickup in time , and his father and his gang are arrested . Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright , and Mike , certain that the prize money is as good as his , buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse , and then swindles a group of bears in a card game at a nightclub .   The day of the screening , the bears interrupt the show , demanding the money from Mike , who in turn , points to Buster . The bears open the chest containing the prize money , but it is nowhere near $100,000 . The glass tank full of luminescent squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks under all their weight , flooding the theater , which then comes crashing down . With the lot repossessed by Judith , Buster , who had been living in his theater 's office desk , takes up residence at Eddie 's place ( his parents ' pool house ) . Although the contestants ( besides Mike , who saw Buster as a fraud ) visit him and try to cheer him up , Buster is too despondent to listen to them . He tries to start over by opening a car wash , using the same bucket that his father had used to earn money for Buster 's theater .   When Meena goes to the theater 's rubble lot and sings Leonard Cohen 's `` Hallelujah , '' Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money . They perform on a makeshift stage on the lot in front of Rosita and Meena 's family members . As Rosita and Gunter perform Taylor Swift 's `` Shake It Off , '' more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news . Johnny 's rendition of Elton John 's `` I 'm Still Standing '' impresses his father , who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him . Despite an interruption by Judith , Ash sings her original rock song `` Set It All Free . '' Mike returns to the show and sings Frank Sinatra 's `` My Way . '' Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings Stevie Wonder 's `` Do n't You Worry ' bout a Thing , '' which literally brings down the house . The show becomes a success and impresses Nana , who was in the audience . Nana buys the lot and the theater is rebuilt and reopened .

who wrote cant get you out of my head lyrics,"[""`` Spinning Around '' was released as the lead single from the album , and it was a commercial success , attaining a platinum certification in Australia for shipment of 70,000 units , and a silver certification in the United Kingdom for shipment of 200,000 units . She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour . Minogue premiered `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' by performing it during the tour , and soon after , discussion regarding the song `` quickly set online messageboards alight . '' `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was chosen as the lead single from Minogue 's eighth studio album , Fever , and it was released on 8 September 2001 by Parlophone in Australia , while in the United Kingdom and other European countries it was released on 17 September .  My A&R at the time , Miles Leonard and Jamie Nelson , said , `` We 've got something . Come into the office . We 've got to play you something . '' So I went to the EMI office , and I had the same reaction you did , about 20 seconds in . I could n't even fathom what I was hearing . It just ... did something . I was beside myself . Then at the end of the song , panic set in . I was saying `` Are you sure we 've got this song ? Do n't tell me that we do n't ! Is it secured ? Can we have it ? '' And we did ! And that kick - started a whole different phase in my career .  -- Minogue , about her reaction to hearing the demo of the song .   `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was jointly written , composed , and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis . Dennis and Davis had been brought together by British artist manager Simon Fuller , who wanted the duo to come up with a song for British pop group S Club 7 . The song was recorded using Cubase music software , which Davis ran on his Mac computer . Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop , on which Dennis , herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States , began singing the line `` I just ca n't get you out of my head '' in the key of D minor . After three and a half hours , the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards . Dennis called their recording setup for the song `` the most primitive set - up you could imagine ! Different producers work in different ways . But it 's good to be reminded you do n't have to be reliant on equipment . A song is about melody and lyrics and being able to take something away in your memory that is going to haunt you . '' She also regarded their production as a `` very natural and fluid process , '' saying : `` We know how hard we work sometimes to write songs and then spend months picking them to pieces , but this was the easiest process , the chemicals were all happy and working together . ''   But after Fuller heard the demo , he felt it was wrong for S Club 7 and rejected it ; English singer - songwriter Sophie Ellis - Bextor also turned down the offer to record it . Davis then met with Minogue 's A&R executive , Jamie Nelson . After hearing the demo cassette of the song , Nelson booked it for Minogue to record later that year . Nelson was impressed by the `` vibe '' of the song and felt it would please the `` danceheads . '' Although Davis was initially under the impression that the recording deal would be called off later , Minogue became enthusiastic to record the song after hearing 20 seconds of the demo ."", ""The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours as of 2017 , with the exception of the Anti Tour . Following its release , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' ranked on a number of decade - end lists compiled by magazines such as Rolling Stone , The Guardian , and NME .

who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"[""He is dethroned by the spectre of an actor , and we shall never be able to keep the usurper out of our dreams .  Maurice Maeterlinck in La Jeune Belgique ( 1890 ) .   Shakespeare 's day to the Interregnum ( edit )   Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage . He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range . Judging by the number of reprints , Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare 's fourth most popular play during his lifetime -- only Henry IV Part 1 , Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it . Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set ; however , as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets , this would not have affected the staging .   Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant . What is known is that the crew of the ship Red Dragon , anchored off Sierra Leone , performed Hamlet in September 1607 ; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare 's death ; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637 . Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that , since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet ( only Falstaff is mentioned more , from Shakespeare ) , the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses .   All theatres were closed down by the Puritan government during the Interregnum . Even during this time , however , playlets known as drolls were often performed illegally , including one called The Grave - Makers based on Act 5 , Scene 1 of Hamlet .   Restoration and 18th century ( edit )  Title page and frontispiece for Hamlet , Prince of Denmark : A Tragedy . As it is now acted at the Theatres - Royal in Drury - Lane and Covent - Garden . London , 1776  The play was revived early in the Restoration . When the existing stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies , Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant 's Duke 's Company secured . It became the first of Shakespeare 's plays to be presented with movable flats painted with generic scenery behind the proscenium arch of Lincoln 's Inn Fields Theatre . This new stage convention highlighted the frequency with which Shakespeare shifts dramatic location , encouraging the recurrent criticism of his failure to maintain unity of place . In the title role , Davenant cast Thomas Betterton , who continued to play the Dane until he was 74 . David Garrick at Drury Lane produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily ; he declared : `` I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act . I have brought it forth without the grave - digger 's trick , Osrick , & the fencing match '' . The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is Lewis Hallam . Jr. , in the American Company 's production in Philadelphia in 1759 .  David Garrick 's iconic hand gesture expresses Hamlet 's shock at the first sight of the ghost ( artist : unknown ) .  John Philip Kemble made his Drury Lane debut as Hamlet in 1783 . His performance was said to be 20 minutes longer than anyone else 's , and his lengthy pauses provoked the suggestion by Richard Brinsley Sheridan that `` music should be played between the words '' ."", ""He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century .   Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) . Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others . The play 's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny . One such example is the centuries - old debate about Hamlet 's hesitation to kill his uncle , which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action , but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold - blooded murder , calculated revenge , and thwarted desire . More recently , psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet 's unconscious desires , while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude .

For other uses , see Hamlet ( disambiguation ) . The American actor Edwin Booth as Hamlet , ca . 1870  The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , often shortened to Hamlet ( / ˈhæmlɪt / ) , is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602 . Set in Denmark , the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle , Claudius , by the ghost of Hamlet 's father , King Hamlet . Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne , also marrying his deceased brother 's widow .   Hamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play , and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of `` seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others '' . It was probably one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime , and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford - upon - Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers -- from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch -- and has been described as `` the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella '' .   The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th - century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th - century scholar François de Belleforest . Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur - Hamlet , though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur - Hamlet , later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have .

For the film , TV and opera adaptations , see The Great Gatsby ( disambiguation ) .  The Great Gatsby   Cover of the first edition in 1925 .     Author   F. Scott Fitzgerald     Cover artist   Francis Cugat     Country   United States     Language   English     Genre   Novel     Published   April 10 , 1925 ( Charles Scribner 's Sons )     Media type   Print ( hardcover & paperback )     Preceded by   The Beautiful and Damned ( 1922 )     Followed by   Tender Is the Night ( 1934 )     The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval , and excess , creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream .   Fitzgerald -- inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's north shore -- began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , `` something new -- something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . '' Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue .   First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly ; in its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies . Fitzgerald died in 1940 , believing himself to be a failure and his work forgotten . However , the novel experienced a revival during World War II , and became a part of American high school curricula and numerous stage and film adaptations in the following decades . Today , The Great Gatsby is widely considered to be a literary classic and a contender for the title `` Great American Novel . '' In 1998 , the Modern Library editorial board voted it the 20th century 's best American novel and second best English - language novel of the same time period .

Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby 's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald 's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby 's fortune . Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book 's plotline within the historical context of the era .   Fitzgerald 's visits to Long Island 's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby 's setting . Today , there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book . One possibility is Land 's End , a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party . Many of the events in Fitzgerald 's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota , and like Nick , he was educated at an Ivy League school , Princeton ( in Nick 's case , Yale ) . Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby , in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved . Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant , and was stationed at Camp Sheridan , in Montgomery , Alabama . There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen - year - old beauty named Zelda Sayre . Zelda finally agreed to marry him , but her preference for wealth , fun , and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success . Like Nick in The Great Gatsby , Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting , and , like Gatsby , he had always idolized the very rich . In many ways , The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald 's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age . Like Gatsby , Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted , even as she led him toward everything he despised .   In her book Careless People : Murder , Mayhem and the Invention of ' The Great Gatsby ( 2013 ) , Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall - Mills Case . Based on her forensic search for clues , she asserts that the two victims in the Hall - Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby .   Plot summary ( edit )   The main events of the novel take place in the summer of 1922 . Nick Carraway , a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwest -- who serves as the novel 's narrator -- takes a job in New York as a bond salesman . He rents a small house on Long Island , in the fictional village of West Egg , next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby , a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them . Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin , Daisy Fay Buchanan , and her husband , Tom , a college acquaintance of Nick 's . They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker , an attractive , cynical young golfer with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship . She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress , Myrtle Wilson , who lives in the `` valley of ashes '' , an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City ."", ""Like Nick in The Great Gatsby , Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting , and , like Gatsby , he had always idolized the very rich .

Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party , and they meet Gatsby himself , an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War . Through Jordan , Nick later learns that Gatsby knew Daisy through a purely chance meeting in 1917 , when Daisy and her friends were doing volunteer services ' work with young Officers headed to Europe . From their brief meetings and casual encounters at that time , Gatsby became ( and still is ) deeply in love with Daisy . Even more , he became obsessed with the idea of her , and the ideal of living in the world he saw her living in , as the fulfillment of all the possible dreams he could ever have .   Jordan confides in Nick that the only reason Gatsby bought the mansion is because it was across the bay from Tom and Daisy 's home , and that Gatsby 's extravagant lifestyle and wild parties were an attempt to impress Daisy and raise her curiosity about her `` anonymous '' neighbor across the bay . Gatsby had hoped that one day curiosity would have brought the unsuspecting Daisy to appear at his doorstep , and thereby he 'd be able to present himself as a `` new man '' , now of wealth and position , and now able to join her at her side and within her world .""]","[""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.

what purpose did seasonal monsoon winds have on trade,"[""The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the sea '' but also `` return from the sea '' ) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around 30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation , which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta 's voyage in 1565 .   The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all .   By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England 's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of ' trade ' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world 's oceans .   Cause ( edit )  3D map showing Hadley cells in relationship to trade winds on the surface . See also : Air mass , Hadley cell , Humidity , Intertropical Convergence Zone , Monsoon , Monsoon trough , Near - equatorial trough , and Prevailing winds  As part of the Hadley cell circulation , surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles . A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone ."", 'Maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses . The one region of the Earth which has an absence of trade winds is the north Indian ocean .   Weather effects ( edit )   Clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres ( 13,000 ft ) in height , and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion . Trade winds originate more from the direction of the poles ( northeast in the Northern Hemisphere , southeast in the Southern Hemisphere ) during the cold season , and are stronger in the winter than the summer . As an example , the windy season in the Guianas , which lie at low latitudes in South America , occurs between January and April . When the phase of the Arctic oscillation ( AO ) is warm , trade winds are stronger within the tropics . The cold phase of the AO leads to weaker trade winds . When the trade winds are weaker , more extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics , such as Central America .   During mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere ( July ) , the westward - moving trade winds south of the northward - moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean sea into southeastern North America ( Florida and Gulf Coast ) . When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land , rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets . Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates . Although the Southeast USA has some of the cleanest air in North America , much of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida . Since 1970 , dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa . There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year . Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida , primarily since the 1970s .

These winds allowed for predictable sailing routes, enabling traders to travel between regions such as East Africa, the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. The monsoon winds would blow in one direction for part of the year and reverse direction for the other part, allowing traders to plan their voyages accordingly and ensuring efficient and reliable trade routes.",enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans

when is the next deadpool movie being released,"[""Noting the release date , Leitch wanted to ensure that the film `` was worthy of a summer tentpole movie , and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films '' , specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film `` bigger '' than the first one . However , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '' of combining that with the increased scope . The film uses Deadpool 's fourth wall - breaking to reference this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh and timely when they come up . '' In May 2017 , Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool 2 to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds , Brolin , and Beetz in an X-Force film . Casting for the characters -- Sunspot , Feral , and Shatterstar -- would take place over the coming months , though Reese denied the accuracy of this report . Later , T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return from the first film as Weasel , and described the sequel as `` even more weaselicious '' than the first . He noted that Reynolds and the writers had `` really put the time in on the script '' to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans . Jack Kesy also joined the cast , as Black Tom Cassidy . In June , Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film .   Filming   Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films . Principal photography began in Vancouver on June 26 , under the working title Love Machine . Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film . At the end of June , Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film . The next month , T.J.

where did the idea of fortnite come from,"[""Development   History   Fortnite was first revealed at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards ( VGA ) , with Epic 's former design director Cliff Bleszinski introducing a trailer for the game . Donald Mustard , creative lead at Epic , said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea , before we even made the game '' . The title , which started out as an internal game jam project , represents a departure from the company 's previous work . As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event , Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite , describing it as `` a world where you explore , you scavenge , you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget , he also echoed these statements , claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that , right ? But creatively for the team , Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' , and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons . ''   As the game was at its very preliminary stages at the VGA reveal , the goal of this reveal was to seek public interest in the title and potential publishing partners as to decide on the game 's release platforms and timeframe . During the July 2012 San Diego Comic Con , Epic announced that Fortnite would be an exclusive personal computer title , and the first one to be developed by Epic using their new Unreal 4 game engine , with a planned release in 2013 . The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time ."", ""The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time . They further opted for personal computer exclusivity to avoid the difficulty of having to go through console certification , and as they planned to be constantly monitoring and tweaking the game , acting as a dungeon master , the personal computer approach would allow them to do this without restrictions normally set by console manfuctures . Bleszinski later clarified that they would not rule out release on other platforms as they developed the title .  Fortnite cosplayers at Gamescom 2017  Fortnite 's development was spread among several of Epic 's satellite studios , and was also co-developed by the Polish studio People Can Fly , which had worked with Epic previously on earlier games , and had been fully acquired by Epic sometime in 2012 . People Can Fly were briefly renamed Epic Games Poland in 2013 as to align with Epic 's other studios . By March 2014 , there were about 90 developers working on the game . People Can Fly later returned to being an independent studio and their own name in 2015 , but continued to help Epic with Fortnite 's development .   During Fortnite 's development , Epic had seen the game industry shifting to games as a service model . To help with this transition , the company brought in Tencent who had several games operating under this model . As part of this agreement , Tencent bought a significant share of ownership in Epic Games through stock acquisition around June 2012 . The shifting of Epic 's approach through Tencent led to the departure of some high - level staff later that year , including Bleszinski . Fortnite was seen as the spearhead for Epic 's games - as - a-service model as they collaborated with Tencent . This caused some road bumps in the development of Fortnite , according to Mustard . Fortnite 's development was also slowed as it was used as the testing ground for the new features of the Unreal 4 engine .   By November 2013 , Epic confirmed that Fortnite would not release that year , nor offered a target released date , though affirmed the game was still in development by several of its studios ."", ""At the time of the start of early access , Gearbox Software helped distribute the game on physical media .   With the popularity of Fortnite Battle Royale , which was first released in early access around September 2017 and gained considerable attention by early 2018 , Epic split off a separate development team to focus on improvements for this mode . Epic said that their attention to Fortnite was causing some of their other games to see lower player populations , leading them to reduce development efforts on these games , particularly Paragon . By the end of January 2018 , Epic announced it was shutting down Paragon by April of that year , providing refunds to all players . Players on a Fortnite - dedicated Reddit forum had expressed concerns that a similar fate could befall the Save the World mode of Fortnite , as externally , the Save the World mode has not received the same attention in providing updates and improvements compared to the Battle Royale mode since that mode 's release . Epic 's Ed Zobrist said that as of March 2018 that the retention rates for `` Save the World '' have been high , and have grown since the release of Fortnite Battle Royale , and the company has since improved communications with the player base , such as providing development road maps and known bug lists .   Art and design   In their initial prototypes of the game , Epic had used creepier and darker designs for the husks and other enemies . Bleszinski said that they found this to create an `` exhaustive environment '' that was too grim , and designed to take the design in a more cartoonish approach , while still remaining creepy , so that players would enjoy spending time in the game 's world , without competing with games like DayZ . They used works from Pixar , Tim Burton , and Looney Tunes as inspiration for the designs .   Fortnite uses procedural generation to build out the maps for each mission . The game also includes an `` AI director '' that monitors how players are progressing , and alters the challenges of the monsters it sends out to the players based on that progression , easing off if players are having greater difficulty in surviving . At one point , the game had a team - based player versus player mode , where each side attempted to build up a base around a central target while trying to attack the opponent 's target after breaking through their base . This did not make it into the final game .""]","[""Fortnite is set in contemporary Earth, where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98% of the world's population to disappear, and zombie-like creatures rise to attack the remainder. Considered by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead, Fortnite has up to four players cooperating on various missions on randomly-generated maps to collect resources, build fortifications around defensive objectives that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors, and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives. Players gain rewards through these missions to improve their hero characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions. The game is supported through microtransactions to purchase in-game currency that can be used towards these upgrades.""]","The idea for Fortnite originated from an internal game jam project at Epic Games.

These are stations that broadcast on behalf of various political movements such as rebel or insurrectionist forces ."", 'Additionally , international broadcasters sometimes operate outside the normal WRC - allocated bands or use off - channel frequencies . This is done for practical reasons , or to attract attention in crowded bands ( 60m , 49m , 40m , 41m , 31m , 25m ) .   The new digital audio broadcasting format for shortwave DRM operates 10 kHz or 20 kHz channels . There are some ongoing discussions with respect to specific band allocation for DRM , as it mainly transmitted in 10 kHz format .   The power used by shortwave transmitters ranges from less than one watt for some experimental and amateur radio transmissions to 500 kilowatts and higher for intercontinental broadcasters and over-the - horizon radar . Shortwave transmitting centers often use specialized antenna designs ( like the ALLISS antenna technology ) to concentrate radio energy at the target area .   Advantages ( edit )  Soviet shortwave listener in Borisoglebsk , 1941  Shortwave does possess a number of advantages over newer technologies , including the following :    Difficulty of censoring programming by authorities in restrictive countries : unlike their relative ease in monitoring the Internet , government authorities face technical difficulties monitoring which stations ( sites ) are being listened to ( accessed ) . For example , during the attempted coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , when his access to communications was limited ( e.g. his phones were cut off , etc . ) , Gorbachev was able to stay informed by means of the BBC World Service on shortwave .   Low - cost shortwave radios are widely available in all but the most repressive countries in the world . Simple shortwave regenerative receivers can be easily built with a few parts .   In many countries ( particularly in most developing nations and in the Eastern bloc during the Cold War era ) ownership of shortwave receivers has been and continues to be widespread ( in many of these countries some domestic stations also used shortwave ) .   Many newer shortwave receivers are portable and can be battery - operated , making them useful in difficult circumstances . Newer technology includes hand - cranked radios which provide power without batteries .   Shortwave radios can be used in situations where Internet or satellite communications service is temporarily or long - term unavailable ( or unaffordable ) .   Shortwave radio travels much farther than broadcast FM ( 88 -- 108 MHz ) .', ""Shortwave radio is used for broadcasting of voice and music to shortwave listeners over very large areas ; sometimes entire continents or beyond . It is also used for military over-the - horizon radar , diplomatic communication , and two - way international communication by amateur radio enthusiasts for hobby , educational and emergency purposes , as well as for long distance aviation and marine communications .

the south west wind blows across nigeria between,"[""West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time . The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa . Temperatures can climb as high as 35 ° C ( 95.0 ° F ) over west Africa during this time . Temperatures in the northern part of Nigeria can go as high as 48 ° C ( 118.4 ° F ) in cities like Maiduguri .   The high temperatures coupled with an increase in insolation causes a region of low pressure to develop over west Africa and Nigeria ( between March to May ) . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) from the Sahara Desert in the northern part of West Africa , is weakened due to the overheating of the land surface in west Africa and Nigeria at this time . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) begins to retreat northwards to the Sahara Desert due to massive heating of the land which transfers heat in the form of convection into the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) which constitutes the main layer of air above the land . This transfer of heat in the Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) in turn , causes the wind to expand and become lighter as this is the normal behaviour for winds moving above intensely heated grounds . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) loses its strength as a major airmass in the region of west Africa and over Nigeria at this time ( around February in the southern part of Nigeria to June in northern Nigeria ) and begins to retreat coupled with the rising of air in form of convection within this airmass ( Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) ) , further weakening the dominance of the wind over west Africa and Nigeria . The Tropical continental airmass ( CT ) finally retreats from most part of Nigeria , and the West African atmosphere around April to May , leaving an empty atmosphere over Nigeria . The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun .

The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth . Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the obudu plateau or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of cumulonimbus cloud leading to thunderstorms within the airmass .   During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) in the rainy season of Nigeria , mornings are bright and sunny , the sun 's heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents , these currents rise vertically and cumulonimbus clouds are formed , by afternoons to evenings , torrential downpour follows .   The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria .   The nature of this waves changes at about the 15 degrees line . The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds . Nigeria 's northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees . Nigeria 's location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons .   Tropical continental airmass ( edit )   The Tropical Continental Airmass ( CT ) locally known as the harmattan , is a wind originating from North Africa which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria . This airmass dominates Nigeria 's climate during the dry season from December to March ."", ""Due to their location in the tropics , this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands , mountains and the plateau regions standing above this height , a cool mountain climate .   Seasons ( edit )   Nigeria , like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands , has only two seasons . These are the dry season and the rainy season . The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert , locally known as Harmattan , or by its main name , The Tropical Continental ( CT ) airmass , while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean , locally known as the south west wind , or by its main name , The Tropical Maritime ( MT ) airmass . These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the trade winds .   Trade winds ( edit )   Tropical Maritime airmass ( edit )   The tropical maritime airmass ( MT ) is responsible for Nigeria 's rainy season . This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June . Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat , of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) known as the harmattan . The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) , is caused by the sun 's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere . This shift begins from February and ends in June , when the sun is fully overhead , at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis , the sun crosses the equator ( around March ) , moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere .

In his 1971 Nowruz ( New Year ) speech , the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year , during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy . It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized . The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran 's political system , associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia 's past , and with Cyrus in particular . The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as `` a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create .

who was the governor general of india when country became independent,"[""The governor - general ( now also the viceroy ) headed the central government of India , which administered the provinces of British India , including the Punjab , Bengal , Bombay , Madras , the United Provinces , and others . However , much of India was not ruled directly by the British government ; outside the provinces of British India , there were hundreds of nominally sovereign princely states or `` native states '' , whose relationship was not with the British government , but directly with the monarch . To reflect the governor - general 's role as the representative of the monarch to the feudal rulers of the princely states , from 1858 the term Viceroy and Governor - General of India ( known in short as the Viceroy of India ) was applied to him .   The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India split into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan , but the office of governor - general continued to exist in each country separately -- until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956 , respectively .   Until 1858 , the governor - general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company , to whom he was responsible . Thereafter , he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British government ; the Secretary of State for India , a member of the UK Cabinet , was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of his powers . After 1947 , the sovereign continued to appoint the governor - general , but did so on the advice of the Indian government .   Governors - General served at the pleasure of the sovereign , though the practice was to have them serve five - year terms . Governors - General could have their commission rescinded ; and if one was removed , or left , a provisional governor - general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen . The first Governor - General of British India was Warren Hastings , and the first Governor - General of independent India was Louis Mountbatten .

The Regulating Act , however , granted them additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence . The other Presidencies of the East India Company ( Madras , Bombay and Bencoolen ) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the Governor - General and Council of Fort William .   The powers of the Governor - General , in respect of foreign affairs , were increased by the India Act 1784 . The Act provided that the other Governors under the East India Company could not declare war , make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the Governor - General or by the Company 's Court of Directors .   While the Governor - General thus became the controller of foreign policy in India , he was not the explicit head of British India . That status came only with the Charter Act 1833 , which granted him `` superintendence , direction and control of the whole civil and military Government '' of all of British India . The Act also granted legislative powers to the Governor - General and Council .   After 1858 , the Governor - General ( now usually known as the Viceroy ) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the Sovereign 's representative . India was divided into numerous provinces , each under the head of a Governor , Lieutenant Governor or Chief Commissioner or Administrator . Governors were appointed by the British Government , to whom they were directly responsible ; Lieutenant Governors , Chief Commissioners , and Administrators , however , were appointed by and were subordinate to the Viceroy . The Viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers : the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Maharaja of Mysore , the Maharaja ( Scindia ) of Gwalior , the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad ( Gaekwar ) Maharaja of Baroda ."", ""Only the first and last Governors - General -- Warren Hastings and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari -- as well as some provisional Governors - General , had no honorific titles at all .

This flag was not the Viceroy 's personal flag ; it was also used by Governors , Lieutenant Governors , Chief Commissioners and other British officers in India . When at sea , only the Viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast , while other officials flew it from the foremast .   From 1947 to 1950 , the Governor - General of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest ( a lion standing on the Crown ) , beneath which was the word ' India ' in gold majuscules . The same design is still used by many other Commonwealth Realm Governors - General . This last flag was the personal flag of the Governor - General only .

Lord Wellesley , who is reputed to have said that ' India should be governed from a palace , not from a country house ' , constructed a grand mansion , known as Government House , between 1799 and 1803 . The mansion remained in use until the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912 . Thereafter , the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal , who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House , was upgraded to a full Governor and transferred to Government House . Now , it serves as the residence of the Governor of the Indian state of West Bengal , and is referred to by its Bengali name Raj Bhavan .

what happens to the rbc in acute hemolytic reaction,"[""The former results in a severe intravascular hemolysis and the latter typically causes extravascular hemolysis . The reactions are mediated by cytokines like TNF , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein , IL - 1 etc .

Prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of renal failure may include low - dose dopamine , vigorous hydration with intravenous crystalloid solutions ( e.g. , lactated Ringer 's solution or normal saline ) , and osmotic diuresis with mannitol .   If DIC is documented and bleeding requires treatment , transfusions of frozen plasma , pooled cryoprecipitates for fibrinogen , and / or platelet concentrates may be indicated .     In case of non-antibody mediated AHR   This does not require rigorous management .   Diuresis induced by an infusion of normal saline until the intense red color of hemoglobinuria ceases is usually adequate treatment .

It is also known as an `` immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction '' .

where did the first african american air force unit train,"[""Army flight surgeons had been black .   Training of African - American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943 , when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field , Texas . This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army . Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941 - 49 . At that time , the typical tour of duty for a U.S. Army flight surgeon was four years . Six of these physicians lived under field conditions during operations in North Africa , Sicily , and Italy . The chief flight surgeon to the Tuskegee Airmen was Dr. Vance H. Marchbanks , Jr. , MD , a childhood friend of Benjamin Davis .   The accumulation of washed - out cadets at Tuskegee and the propensity of other commands to `` dump '' African - American personnel on the post exacerbated the difficulties of administering Tuskegee . A shortage of jobs for them made these enlisted men a drag on Tuskegee 's housing and culinary departments .   Trained officers were also left idle , as the plan to shift African - American officers into command slots stalled , and white officers not only continued to hold command , but were joined by additional white officers assigned to the post . One rationale behind the non-assignment of trained African - American officers was stated by the commanding officer of the Army Air Forces , General Henry `` Hap '' Arnold : `` Negro pilots can not be used in our present Air Corps units since this would result in Negro officers serving over white enlisted men creating an impossible social situation . ''   Combat assignment ( edit )  Eight Tuskegee Airmen in front of a P - 40 fighter aircraft  The 99th was finally considered ready for combat duty by April 1943 . It shipped out of Tuskegee on 2 April , bound for North Africa , where it would join the 33rd Fighter Group and its commander , Colonel William W. Momyer . Given little guidance from battle - experienced pilots , the 99th 's first combat mission was to attack the small strategic volcanic island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean Sea to clear the sea lanes for the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 . The air assault on the island began 30 May 1943 ."", "". It also included a Hispanic or Latino airman born in the Dominican Republic .   Although the 477th Bombardment Group trained with North American B - 25 Mitchell bombers , they never served in combat . The 99th Pursuit Squadron ( later , 99th Fighter Squadron ) was the first black flying squadron , and the first to deploy overseas ( to North Africa in April 1943 , and later to Sicily and Italy ) . The 332nd Fighter Group , which originally included the 100th , 301st , and 302nd Fighter Squadrons , was the first black flying group . It deployed to Italy in early 1944 . In June 1944 , the 332nd Fighter Group began flying heavy bomber escort missions , and in July 1944 , with the addition of the 99th Fighter Squadron , it had four fighter squadrons .   The 99th Fighter Squadron was initially equipped with Curtiss P - 40 Warhawk fighter - bomber aircraft . The 332nd Fighter Group and its 100th , 301st and 302nd Fighter Squadrons were equipped for initial combat missions with Bell P - 39 Airacobras ( March 1944 ) , later with Republic P - 47 Thunderbolts ( June -- July 1944 ) , and finally with the aircraft with which they became most commonly associated , the North American P - 51 Mustang ( July 1944 ) . When the pilots of the 332nd Fighter Group painted the tails of their P - 47s red , the nickname `` Red Tails '' was coined . The red markings that distinguished the Tuskegee Airmen included red bands on the noses of P - 51s as well as a red rudder ; the P - 51B and D Mustangs flew with similar color schemes , with red propeller spinners , yellow wing bands and all - red tail surfaces .   The Tuskegee Airmen were the first African - American military aviators in the United States Armed Forces . During World War II , black Americans in many U.S. states were still subject to the Jim Crow laws and the American military was racially segregated , as was much of the federal government . The Tuskegee Airmen were subjected to discrimination , both within and outside the army ."", ""African - American contractor McKissack and McKissack , Inc. was in charge of the contract . The company 's 2,000 workmen , the Alabama Works Progress Administration , and the U.S. Army built the airfield in only six months . The construction was budgeted at $1,663,057 . The airmen were placed under the command of Captain Benjamin O. Davis , Jr. , one of only two black line officers then serving .   During training , Tuskegee Army Air Field was commanded first by Major James Ellison . Ellison made great progress in organizing the construction of the facilities needed for the military program at Tuskegee . However , he was transferred on 12 January 1942 , reputedly because of his insistence that his African - American sentries and Military Police had police authority over local Caucasian civilians .   His successor , Colonel Frederick von Kimble , then oversaw operations at the Tuskegee airfield . Contrary to new Army regulations , Kimble maintained segregation on the field in deference to local customs in the state of Alabama , a policy that was resented by the airmen . Later that year , the Air Corps replaced Kimble . His replacement had been the director of instruction at Tuskegee Army Airfield , Major Noel F. Parrish . Counter to the prevalent racism of the day , Parrish was fair and open - minded and petitioned Washington to allow the Tuskegee Airmen to serve in combat .  Instrument certificate for Tuskegee Airman Robert M. Glass , signed by Parrish  The strict racial segregation the U.S. Army required gave way in the face of the requirements for complex training in technical vocations . Typical of the process was the development of separate African - American flight surgeons to support the operations and training of the Tuskegee Airmen . Before the development of this unit , no U.S. Army flight surgeons had been black .   Training of African - American men as aviation medical examiners was conducted through correspondence courses until 1943 , when two black physicians were admitted to the U.S. Army School of Aviation Medicine at Randolph Field , Texas . This was one of the earliest racially integrated courses in the U.S. Army . Seventeen flight surgeons served with the Tuskegee Airmen from 1941 - 49 .""]","['All black military pilots who trained in the United States trained at Moton Field, the Tuskegee Army Air Field, and were educated at Tuskegee University, located near Tuskegee, Alabama.

However , these `` seasons '' only correspond to story arcs ( which are themselves split at debatable points ) , and not to the pattern in which the show actually aired in either Japan or the United States .   In Japan , Dragon Ball Z ( like both of the other Dragon Ball series ) was aired year - round continuously , with regular off - days for sporting events and television specials taking place about once every six weeks on average .

In the style of the original Law & Order , episodes are often `` ripped from the headlines '' or loosely based on real crimes that have received media attention ."", ""from left : Esparza , Giddish , Hargitay , Ice - T , Peter Scanavino  Casting for the lead characters of Law & Order : Special Victims Unit occurred in the spring of 1999 . Dick Wolf , along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center . The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists . For the female lead , Detective Olivia Benson , actresses Samantha Mathis , Reiko Aylesworth , and Mariska Hargitay were being considered . For the male role , Detective Elliot Stabler , the finalists were Tim Matheson , John Slattery , Nick Chinlund , and Christopher Meloni . Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and , after the actors left , there was a moment of dead silence , after which Wolf blurted out , `` Oh well . There 's no doubt who we should choose -- Hargitay and Meloni . '' Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together , and they ended up being his first choice . Garth Ancier , then head of NBC Entertainment , agreed , and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent .   The first actor to be cast for the show was Dann Florek . Florek had originated the character of Captain Don Cragen in the 1988 pilot for Law & Order and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives , who wanted to add female characters to the all male primary cast . He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf , however , and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show . Shortly after Florek reprised his role for Exiled : A Law & Order Movie , he received a call to be on Sex Crimes . Initially reluctant , he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role .   Shortly after the cancellation of Homicide : Life on the Street , Richard Belzer heard that Benjamin Bratt had left Law & Order ."", 'Title: Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\nLaw & Order : Special Victims Unit - Wikipedia  Law & Order : Special Victims Unit  Jump to : navigation , search For the current season , see Law & Order : Special Victims Unit ( season 19 ) .

who designed the garden city of new earswick,"[""There was housing for both workers and managers , in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees . It was founded by the York philanthropist , Joseph Rowntree , who was quoted as saying , `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin , after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .   The village had contemporaries such as Bournville , Saltaire , Port Sunlight and others . This was in sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century , the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree 's report of 1901 , entitled Poverty : a study of town life . It revealed appalling statistics of dark , overcrowded and insanitary housing .   As a result of the report , Joseph Rowntree 's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick , two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York . The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new ' garden ' village and the detailed designs for its first houses . They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City .   The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low , but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested . Houses were open to any working people , not just Rowntree employees . The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick ."", ""The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick . From 1950 the brickyard , which closed down in the 1930s , was developed into a nature reserve .   Due to their religious beliefs , The Rowntree family decreed there would not be a public house in the village . There never has been , although the Sports Club obtained a drink 's license in the 1980s .   Governance ( edit )   New Earswick is part of the Huntington & New Earswick Ward of the City of York Council . As of 2010 it is represented by Keith Hyman , Keith Orrel and Carol Runciman who are all members of the local Liberal Democrat Party .   A Parish Council was created in 1934 consisting of ten elected councillors and a clerk .   Community ( edit )   There is a local community centre , the Folk Hall , which hosts activities such as keep - fit , yoga , snooker , and a junior youth club . New Earswick has recreational facilities , including a swimming pool ( due for closure without public consultation ) , tennis courts and football , rugby and cricket pitches at the New Earswick Sports and Social Club . There were two open access play areas close to the Folk Hall , including a hard surface play area which have recently been bulldozed for a development of houses . There is a library based in the Integrated Children 's Centre at the local primary school , a doctor 's surgery and a range of shops , including two general stores , a pet shop and Post Office . As of 2017 the Post Office is situated within the Folk Hall .   The village has 36 allotments in two areas , Willow Bank and Sleeper Path .   In the 1960s , the Folk Hall was a live music venue featuring the likes of Procol Harum and Pink Floyd .   Geography ( edit )   The River Foss runs along the eastern boundary of New Earswick with the York to Scarborough Line running to the west ."", ""Archived from the original on 16 January 2008 .

Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species , that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance `` absurd in the highest possible degree '' . However , he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it , its evolution was perfectly feasible :   ... if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist , each grade being useful to its possessor , as is certainly the case ; if further , the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited , as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory .   He suggested a stepwise evolution from `` an optic nerve merely coated with pigment , and without any other mechanism '' to `` a moderately high stage of perfection '' , and gave examples of existing intermediate steps . Darwin 's suggestions were soon shown to be correct , and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution .   Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors . Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates . Another researcher , G.C. Young , has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions , based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through . All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin 's theory .   Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' ."", ""Title: Evolution of the eye\nEvolution of the eye - wikipedia  Evolution of the eye  Jump to : navigation , search Major stages in the evolution of the eye in vertebrates .  The evolution of the eye is attractive to study , because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms . Complex , image - forming eyes have evolved independently several times . The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion . According his theory , the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells ( so called Pax 6 genes ) appeared probably at once in the life history , at a very early stage of the evolution . Probably , the complex , image forming kinds of eyes are at least five : Chidaria - lens eye , complex eye ; Molluscs - lens eye , everse retina ; Annelids - lens eye , everse retina ; Arthropods - facet eye ; Vertebrate - lens eye , inverse retina   Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion . From before the Cambrian , no evidence of eyes has survived , but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian , and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale . Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners . They vary in their visual acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light , their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colours .

Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' . One of the many hypotheses for `` causes '' of the Cambrian explosion is the `` Light Switch '' theory of Andrew Parker : It holds that the evolution of eyes started an arms race that accelerated evolution . Before the Cambrian explosion , animals may have sensed light , but did not use it for fast locomotion or navigation by vision .   The rate of eye evolution is difficult to estimate , because the fossil record , particularly of the lower Cambrian , is poor . How fast a circular patch of photoreceptor cells evolve into a fully functional vertebrate eye has been estimated based on rates of mutation , relative advantage to the organism , and natural selection . However , the time needed for each state was consistently overestimated and the generation time was set to one year , which is common in small animals . Even with these pessimistic values , the vertebrate eye would still evolve from a patch of photoreceptor cells in less than 364,000 years .   One origin or many ? ( edit )   Whether the eye evolved once or many times depends on the definition of an eye . All eyed animals share much of the genetic machinery for eye development . This suggests that the ancestor of eyed animals had some form of light - sensitive machinery -- even if it was not a dedicated optical organ . However , even photoreceptor cells may have evolved more than once from molecularly similar chemoreceptor cells . Probably , photoreceptor cells existed long before the Cambrian explosion . Higher - level similarities -- such as the use of the protein crystallin in the independently derived cephalopod and vertebrate lenses -- reflect the co-option of a more fundamental protein to a new function within the eye .

In humans , the pear - shaped gallbladder lies beneath the liver , although the structure and position of the gallbladder can vary significantly among animal species . It receives and stores bile , produced by the liver , via the common hepatic duct , and releases it via the common bile duct into the duodenum , where the bile helps in the digestion of fats .   The gallbladder can be affected by gallstones , formed by material that can not be dissolved -- usually cholesterol or bilirubin , a product of haemoglobin breakdown . These may cause significant pain , particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen , and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy . Cholecystitis , inflammation of the gallbladder , has a wide range of causes , including result from the impaction of gallstones , infection , and autoimmune disease .', 'The outer layer of the fundus of gallbladder , and the surfaces not in contact with the liver , are covered by a thick serosa , which is exposed to the peritoneum . The serosa contains blood vessels and lymphatics . The surfaces in contact with the liver are covered in connective tissue .   Variation ( edit )   The gallbladder varies in size , shape , and position between different people . Rarely , two or even three gallbladders may coexist , either as separate bladders draining into the cystic duct , or sharing a common branch that drains into the cystic duct . Additionally , the gallbladder may fail to form at all . Gallbladders with two lobes separated by a septum may also exist . These abnormalities are not likely to affect function and are generally asymptomatic .   The location of the gallbladder in relation to the liver may also vary , with documented variants including gallbladders found within , above , on the left side of , behind , and detached or suspended from the liver . Such variants are very rare : from 1886 to 1998 , only 110 cases of left - lying liver , or less than one per year , were reported in scientific literature .   An anatomical variation can occur , known as a Phrygian cap , which is an innocuous fold in the fundus , named after its resemblance to the Phrygian cap .   Development ( edit )   The gallbladder develops from an endodermal outpouching of the embryonic gut tube . Early in development , the human embryo has three germ layers and abuts an embryonic yolk sac . During the second week of embryogenesis , as the embryo grows , it begins to surround and envelop portions of this sac . The enveloped portions form the basis for the adult gastrointestinal tract . Sections of this foregut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract , such as the esophagus , stomach , and intestines .   During the fourth week of embryological development , the stomach rotates . The stomach , originally lying in the midline of the embryo , rotates so that its body is on the left . This rotation also affects the part of the gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach , which will go on to become the duodenum .', ""These may cause significant pain , particularly in the right upper corner of the abdomen , and are often treated with removal of the gallbladder called a cholecystectomy .

In adults , the gallbladder measures approximately 7 to 10 centimetres ( 2.8 to 3.9 inches ) in length and 4 centimetres ( 1.6 in ) in diameter when fully distended . The gallbladder has a capacity of about 50 millilitres ( 1.8 imperial fluid ounces ) .   The gallbladder is shaped like a pear , with its tip opening into the cystic duct . The gallbladder is divided into three sections : the fundus , body , and neck . The fundus is the rounded base , angled so that it faces the abdominal wall . The body lies in a depression in the surface of the lower liver . The neck tapers and is continuous with the cystic duct , part of the biliary tree . The gallbladder fossa , against which the fundus and body of the gallbladder lie , is found beneath the junction of hepatic segments IVB and V . The cystic duct unites with the common hepatic duct to become the common bile duct .

On 2 February 2008 , Sevilla 's Frédéric Kanouté was named the 2007 African Footballer of the Year . Kanouté , who was born in France , is the first European - born player to win the award ( he plays for his father 's native country of Mali ) .

what is the main mineral in lithium batteries,"[""The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide . Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha .   Regulation ( edit )   Some jurisdictions limit the sale of lithium batteries , which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers . Lithium can be used to reduce pseudoephedrine and ephedrine to methamphetamine in the Birch reduction method , which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous ammonia .   Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation ( particularly aircraft ) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when short - circuited , leading to overheating and possible explosion in a process called thermal runaway . Most consumer lithium batteries have built - in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident , or are otherwise designed to limit short - circuit currents . Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway .

By USGS definitions , the reserve base `` may encompass those parts of the resources that have a reasonable potential for becoming economically available within planning horizons beyond those that assume proven technology and current economics . The reserve base includes those resources that are currently economic ( reserves ) , marginally economic ( marginal reserves ) , and some of those that are currently subeconomic ( subeconomic resources ) . ''   Jump up ^ withheld to avoid disclosing company proprietary data   Jump up ^ Beryllium and fluorine occur only as one isotope , Be and F respectively ."", ""The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is estimated as 230 billion tonnes , where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million ( ppm ) , or 25 micromolar ; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents .   Estimates for the Earth 's crustal content range from 20 to 70 ppm by weight . In keeping with its name , lithium forms a minor part of igneous rocks , with the largest concentrations in granites . Granitic pegmatites also provide the greatest abundance of lithium - containing minerals , with spodumene and petalite being the most commercially viable sources . Another significant mineral of lithium is lepidolite . A newer source for lithium is hectorite clay , the only active development of which is through the Western Lithium Corporation in the United States . At 20 mg lithium per kg of Earth 's crust , lithium is the 25th most abundant element .   According to the Handbook of Lithium and Natural Calcium , `` Lithium is a comparatively rare element , although it is found in many rocks and some brines , but always in very low concentrations . There are a fairly large number of both lithium mineral and brine deposits but only comparatively few of them are of actual or potential commercial value . Many are very small , others are too low in grade . ''   The US Geological Survey estimates that in 2010 , Chile had the largest reserves by far ( 7.5 million tonnes ) and the highest annual production ( 8,800 tonnes ) . One of the largest reserve bases of lithium is in the Salar de Uyuni area of Bolivia , which has 5.4 million tonnes . Other major suppliers include Australia , Argentina and China . As of 2015 Czech Geological Survey considered the entire Ore Mountains in the Czech Republic as lithium province . Five deposits are registered , one near Cínovec ( cs ) is considered as potentially economic deposit with 160 000 tonnes of lithium .   In June 2010 , The New York Times reported that American geologists were conducting ground surveys on dry salt lakes in western Afghanistan believing that large deposits of lithium are located there ."", ""Lithium was used to decrease the melting temperature of glass and to improve the melting behavior of aluminium oxide when using the Hall - Héroult process . These two uses dominated the market until the middle of the 1990s . After the end of the nuclear arms race , the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of Department of Energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices . In the mid 1990s , several companies started to extract lithium from brine which proved to be a less expensive than underground or open - pit mining . Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price . For example , the US mines near Kings Mountain , North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century .   The development of lithium ion batteries increased the demand for lithium and became the dominant use in 2007 . With the surge of lithium demand in batteries in the 2000s , new companies have expanded brine extraction efforts to meet the rising demand .   Production ( edit )  Satellite images of the Salar del Hombre Muerto , Argentina ( left ) , and Uyuni , Bolivia ( right ) , salt flats that are rich in lithium . The lithium - rich brine is concentrated by pumping it into solar evaporation ponds ( visible in the left image ) . World production trend of lithium  Lithium production has greatly increased since the end of World War II . The metal is separated from other elements in igneous minerals . The metal is produced through electrolysis from a mixture of fused 55 % lithium chloride and 45 % potassium chloride at about 450 ° C .   As of 2015 , most of the world 's lithium production is in South America , where lithium - containing brine is extracted from underground pools and concentrated by solar evaporation . The standard extraction technique is to evaporate water from brine . Each batch takes from 18 to 24 months .   In 1998 , the price of lithium was about 95 USD / kg ( or 43 USD / lb ) .   Reserves ( edit )   Worldwide identified reserves in 2008 were estimated by the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) to be 13 million tonnes , though an accurate estimate of world lithium reserves is difficult .""]","['Late in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high energy density, should not be confused with lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode.[104][105] Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.', 'Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.']","The main mineral used in lithium batteries is typically lithium-containing minerals such as spodumene and petalite, which are commercially viable sources of lithium.",lithium
right to property according to the constitution of india is a,"[""Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire , hold and dispose of property . Article 31 provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law . '' It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes .   The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times . The Forty - Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights A new provision , Article 300 - A , was added to the constitution , which provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law '' . Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property , there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation . The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32 . Thus , the right to property is no longer a fundamental right , though it is still a constitutional right . If the government appears to have acted unfairly , the action can be challenged in a court of law by aggrieved citizens .   The liberalisation of the economy and the government 's initiative to set up special economic zones has led to many protests by farmers and have led to calls for the reinstatement of the fundamental right to private property . The Supreme Court has sent a notice to the government questioning why the right should not be brought back but in 2010 the court rejected the PIL   Right to education ( edit )   The right to education at elementary level has been made one of the fundamental rights in 2002 under the Eighty - Sixth Amendment of 2002 . However this right was brought in to implementation after eight years in 2010 . Article 21A -- On 2 April 2010 , India joined a group of few countries in the world , with a historic law making education a fundamental right of every child coming into force . Making elementary education an entitlement for children in the 6 -- 14 age group , the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act will directly benefit children who do not go to school at present . This act provides for appointment of teachers with the requisite entry and academic qualifications .   The former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh announced the operationalisation of the Act ."", ""Violation of these rights result in punishments as prescribed in the Indian Penal Code or other special laws , subject to discretion of the judiciary . The Fundamental Rights are defined as basic human freedoms that every Indian citizen has the right to enjoy for a proper and harmonious development of personality . These rights universally apply to all citizens , irrespective of race , place of birth , religion , caste or gender . Though the rights conferred by the constitution other than fundamental rights are equally valid and their enforcement in case of violation shall be secured from the judiciary in a time consuming legal process . However , in case of fundamental rights violation , Supreme court of India can be approached directly for ultimate justice per Article 32 . The Rights have their origins in many sources , including England 's Bill of Rights , the United States Bill of Rights and France 's Declaration of the Rights of Man .   The six fundamental rights recognised by the Indian constitution are the right to equality , right to freedom , right against exploitation , right to freedom of religion , cultural and educational rights , right to constitutional remedies and right to privacy . The right to equality includes equality before law , prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion , race , caste , gender or place of birth , and equality of opportunity in matters of employment , abolition of untouchability and abolition of titles . The right to freedom includes freedom of speech and expression , assembly , association or union or cooperatives , movement , residence , and right to practice any profession or occupation , right to life and liberty , protection in respect to conviction in offences and protection against arrest and detention in certain cases . The right against exploitation prohibits all forms of forced labour , child labour and trafficking of human beings . The right to freedom of religion includes freedom of conscience and free profession , practice , and propagation of religion , freedom to manage religious affairs , freedom from certain taxes and freedom from religious instructions in certain educational institutes . Cultural and educational rights preserve the right of any section of citizens to conserve their culture , language or script , and right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice .

In 2016 , Adobe renamed Flash Professional , the primary authoring software for Flash content , to Adobe Animate to reflect its growing use for authoring HTML5 content in favour of Flash content .   Open Screen Project ( edit )   On May 1 , 2008 , Adobe announced the Open Screen Project , with the intent of providing a consistent application interface across devices such as personal computers , mobile devices , and consumer electronics . When the project was announced , seven goals were outlined : the abolition of licensing fees for Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime , the removal of restrictions on the use of the Shockwave Flash ( SWF ) and Flash Video ( FLV ) file formats , the publishing of application programming interfaces for porting Flash to new devices , and the publishing of The Flash Cast protocol and Action Message Format ( AMF ) , which let Flash applications receive information from remote databases .   As of February 2009 , the specifications removing the restrictions on the use of SWF and FLV / F4V specs have been published . The Flash Cast protocol -- now known as the Mobile Content Delivery Protocol -- and AMF protocols have also been made available , with AMF available as an open source implementation , BlazeDS .   The list of mobile device providers who have joined the project includes Palm , Motorola , and Nokia , who , together with Adobe , have announced a $10 million Open Screen Project fund . As of 2012 , the Open Screen Project is no longer accepting new applications according to partner BSQuare . However paid licensing is still an option for device makers who want to use Adobe software .   End of life ( edit )   Although Flash was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content , it is slowly being abandoned as Adobe favors a transition to HTML5 due to inherent security flaws and significant resources required to maintain the platform .', 'Adobe Flash Lite enabled viewing Flash content on older smartphones , but has been discontinued and superseded by Adobe AIR .   The ActionScript programming language allows the development of interactive animations , video games , web applications , desktop applications and mobile applications . Programmers can implement Flash software using an IDE such as Adobe Animate , Adobe Flash Builder , Adobe Director , FlashDevelop and Powerflasher FDT . Adobe AIR enables full - featured desktop and mobile applications to be developed with Flash and published for Windows , macOS , Android , iOS , Xbox One , PlayStation 4 , and Nintendo Wii U and Switch .   Although Flash was previously a dominant platform for online multimedia content , it is slowly being abandoned as Adobe favors a transition to HTML5 . Flash Player has been deprecated and has an official end - of - life by 2020 . However , Adobe will continue to develop Adobe AIR , a technology for building applications and games with Flash .

Hinton was 18 when the book was published . The book details the conflict between two rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status : the working - class `` greasers '' and the upper - class `` Socs '' ( pronounced / ˈsoʊʃɪz / -- short for Socials ) . The story is told in first - person perspective by teenaged protagonist Ponyboy Curtis .   The story in the book takes place in Tulsa , Oklahoma , in 1965 , but this is never explicitly stated in the book .   A film adaptation was produced in 1983 , and a little - known short - lived television series appeared in 1990 , picking up where the movie left off .

Hop plants prefer the same soils as potatoes and the leading potato - growing states in the United States are also major hops - producing areas ; however , not all potato - growing areas can produce good hops naturally : soils in the Maritime Provinces of Canada , for example , lack the boron that hops prefer . Historically , hops were not grown in Ireland , but were imported from England . In 1752 more than 500 tons of English hops were imported through Dublin alone .   Important production centres today are the Hallertau in Germany ( more hop - growing area than any other country as of 2006 ) , the Yakima ( Washington ) and Willamette ( Oregon ) valleys , and western Canyon County , Idaho ( including the communities of Parma , Wilder , Greenleaf , and Notus ) .

In Germany , using hops was also a religious and political choice in the early 16th century . There was no tax on hops to be paid on the Catholic church , unlike on gruit , for which the Protestant preferred hopped beer .   Hops used in England were imported from France , Holland and Germany with import duty paid for those ; it was not until 1524 that hops were first grown in the southeast of England ( Kent ) when they were introduced as an agricultural crop by Dutch farmers . Therefore , in the hop industry there are many words which originally were Dutch words ( see oast house ) . Hops were then grown as far north as Aberdeen , near breweries for infrastructure convenience .   According to Thomas Tusser 's 1557 Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry :   `` The hop for his profit I thus do exalt , It strengtheneth drink and it flavoureth malt ; And being well - brewed long kept it will last , And drawing abide , if ye draw not too fast . ''   In England there were many complaints over the quality of imported hops , the sacks of which were often contaminated by stalks , sand or straw to increase their weight . As a result , in 1603 , King James I approved an Act of Parliament banning the practice by which `` the Subjects of this Realm have been of late years abused &c. to the Value of £ 20,000 yearly , besides the Danger of their Healths '' .   Hop cultivation was begun in the present - day United States in 1629 by English and Dutch farmers . Before prohibition , cultivation was mainly centred around New York , California , Oregon , and Washington state . Problems with powdery mildew and downy mildew devastated New York 's production by the 1920s , and California only produces hops on a small scale .   Hop bars were used before modern machinery was invented to make the holes for the hop poles .   World production ( edit )   Hops production is concentrated in moist temperate climates , with much of the world 's production occurring near the 48th parallel north ."", ""p. 245 .

Tiny bulldog ( edit )   This nameless mouse - sized bulldog , designed similarly to Spike the Bulldog , is Jerry 's pet dog companion in only two shorts : The Cat 's Me - Ouch and Purr - Chance to Dream . His role is similar to Spike in cartoons such as The Bodyguard , Fit To Be Tied , and Much Ado About Mousing , which is to defend Jerry against Tom . He is presumably the oldest son of Spike before Tyke , and this could be identified by his looks and personality that is similar to his father Spike . Unlike Spike and Tyke he has a big bite ( similar to those of Looney Tunes ' Tasmanian Devil ) .   Porpoise ( edit )   A shark who tries to eat Tom and Jerry . He appears in Cannery Rodent , Puss ' n ' Boats , Filet Meow and Surf - Bored Cat .

In Tom and Jerry : Spy Quest , they are seen working for Doctor Zin . They also make an appearance in Tom and Jerry : Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory .

Despite being very energetic , determined and much larger , Tom is no match for Jerry 's wits . Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size , approximately the equivalent of Tom 's , lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts . Although cats typically chase mice to consume them , it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to consume Jerry . Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry , sometimes in revenge , and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry . By the final `` fade - out '' of each cartoon , Jerry usually emerges triumphant , while Tom is shown as the loser .   However , other results may be reached . On rare occasions , Tom triumphs , usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or when he pushes Tom a little too far .

In Timid Tabby Tom 's look - alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge .

in which regions are most of africa petroleum and natural gas found,"[""Nigeria is one of the few major oil - producing nations still capable of increasing its oil output . Unlike most of the other OPEC countries , Nigeria is not projected to exceed peak production until at least 2009 . The reason for Nigeria 's relative unproductivity is primarily OPEC regulations on production to regulate prices on the international market . More recently , production has been disrupted intermittently by the protests of the Niger Delta 's inhabitants , who feel they are being exploited .   Nigeria has a total of 159 oil fields and 1481 wells in operation according to the Department of Petroleum Resources . The most productive region of the nation is the coastal Niger Delta Basin in the Niger Delta or `` South - south '' region which encompasses 78 of the 159 oil fields . Most of Nigeria 's oil fields are small and scattered , and as of 1990 , these small unproductive fields accounted for 62.1 % of all Nigerian production . This contrasts with the sixteen largest fields which produced 37.9 % of Nigeria 's petroleum at that time .   As a result of the numerous small fields , an extensive and well - developed pipeline network has been engineered to transport the crude oil . Also because of the lack of highly productive fields , money from the jointly operated ( with the federal government ) companies is constantly directed towards petroleum exploration and production .   Nigeria 's petroleum is classified mostly as `` light '' and `` sweet '' , as the oil is largely free of sulphur . Nigeria is the largest producer of sweet oil in OPEC . This sweet oil is similar in composition to petroleum extracted from the North Sea . This crude oil is known as `` Bonny light '' . Names of other Nigerian crudes , all of which are named according to export terminal , are Qua Ibo , Escravos blend , Brass River , Forcados , and Pennington Anfan .   As recently as 2010 , Nigeria provided about 10 % of overall U.S. oil imports and ranked as the fifth - largest source for oil imports in the U.S. However , Nigeria ceased exports to the US in July 2014 because of the impact of shale production in America ; India is now the largest consumer of Nigerian oil .   There are six petroleum exportation terminals in the country ."", ""In 2008 , the government prepared a Gas Master Plan that was intended to promote natural gas production and encourage the supply of natural gas to domestic power stations so as to help alleviate the country 's electricity shortages . There is also an export gas pipeline , known as the West African Gas Pipeline , in the works but has encountered numerous setbacks . The pipeline would allow for transportation of natural gas to Benin , Ghana , Togo , and Cote d'Ivoire . The majority of Nigeria 's natural gas is flared off and it is estimated that Nigeria loses 18.2 million US $ daily from the loss of the flared gas .

Subsequently , crude oil production for refineries was reduced further to as little as 75,000 barrels ( 11,900 m ) per day during the regime of Sanni Abacha . There are four major oil refineries : the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Plant which can process 125,000 barrels ( 19,900 m ) of crude per day , the New Port Harcourt Refinery which can produce 150,000 barrels ( 24,000 m ) per day ( there is also an ' Old ' Port Harcourt Refinery with negligible production ) , as well as the now defunct Kaduna Refinery . The Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries both operate at only 30 % capacity .   It is estimated that demand and consumption of petroleum in Nigeria grows at a rate of 12.8 % annually . However , petroleum products are unavailable to most Nigerians and are quite costly , because almost all of the oil extracted by the multinational oil companies is refined overseas , while only a limited quantity is supplied to Nigerians themselves .

The enormous pearl is 30 cm wide ( 1 ft ) , 67 cm long ( 2.2 ft ) and weighs 75 lb ( 34 kg ) .   History ( edit )   Pearl hunting ( edit )  Main article : Pearl hunting A 14th - century piece of clothing used by Kuwaiti divers searching for pearls in the Persian Gulf  The ancient chronicle Mahavamsa mentions of the thriving pearl industry in the port of Oruwella in the Gulf of Mannar in Sri Lanka . It also records that eight varieties of pearls accompanied Prince Vijaya 's embassy to the Pandyan king as well as king Devanampiya Tissa 's embassy to Emperor Ashoka . Pliny the Elder ( 23 -- 79AD ) praised the pearl fishery of the Gulf as most productive in the world .   For thousands of years , seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf , the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar . Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions . Starting in the Han Dynasty ( 206 BC -- 220 AD ) , the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea . In the 14th - century Arabian Sea , the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver 's waist .  Catching of pearls , Bern Physiologus ( 9th century )  When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Western Hemisphere , they discovered that around the islands of Cubagua and Margarita , some 200 km north of the Venezuelan coast , was an extensive pearl bed ( a bed of pearl oysters ) . One discovered and named pearl , La Peregrina pearl , was offered to the Spanish queen . According to Garcilasso de la Vega , who says that he saw La Peregrina at Seville in 1607 , this was found at Panama in 1560 by a slave worker who was rewarded with his liberty , and his owner with the office of alcalde of Panama .   Margarita pearls are extremely difficult to find today and are known for their unique yellowish color ."", ""Prized for their exquisitely beautiful ' orient ' or lustre , South Sea pearls are now farmed in various parts of the world where the Pinctada maxima oysters can be found , with the finest South Sea pearls being produced by Paspaley along the remote coastline of North - Western Australia . White and silver colored South Sea pearls tend to come from the Broome area of Australia , while golden colored ones are more prevalent in the Philippines and Indonesia .   A farm in the Gulf of California , Mexico , is culturing pearls from the black lipped Pinctada mazatlanica oysters and the rainbow lipped Pteria sterna oysters . Also called Concha Nácar , the pearls from these rainbow lipped oysters fluoresce red under ultraviolet light .   From other species ( edit )  A shell of the Indian volute , Melo melo , surrounded by a number of pearls from this species Conch pearl pendant  Biologically speaking , under the right set of circumstances , almost any shelled mollusk can produce some kind of pearl . However , most of these molluskan pearls have no luster or iridescence . The great majority of mollusk species produce pearls which are not attractive , and are sometimes not even very durable , such that they usually have no value at all , except perhaps to a scientist or collector , or as a curiosity . These objects used to be referred to as `` calcareous concretions '' by some gemologists , even though a malacologist would still consider them to be pearls . Valueless pearls of this type are sometimes found in edible mussels , edible oysters , escargot snails , and so on . The GIA and CIBJO now simply use the term ' pearl ' ( or , where appropriate , the more descriptive term ' non-nacreous pearl ' ) when referring to such items and , under Federal Trade Commission rules , various mollusk pearls may be referred to as ' pearls ' , without qualification .   A few species produce pearls that can be of interest as gemstones . These species include the bailer shell Melo , the giant clam Tridacna , various scallop species , Pen shells Pinna , and the Haliotis iris species of abalone .""]","[""For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.[29][30][31] Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions.[30][31] Starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea.[citation needed] In the 14th-century Arabian Sea, the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver's waist.[citation needed]""]",Pearls in India are found in the Gulf of Mannar.,the Indian Ocean

Abrams and Michael Arndt , with no direct participation from Star Wars creator George Lucas . According to director Abrams , the First Order is inspired by ODESSA , a theoretical network of SS officers who fled to Argentina following World War II .   Driver 's casting in the film in an unnamed role was first announced on April 29 , 2014 . Kylo Ren was first seen , but still not named , in the 88 - second The Force Awakens teaser trailer released by Lucasfilm on November 28 , 2014 , wielding a jagged red lightsaber with a crossguard . The name Kylo Ren was revealed by Entertainment Weekly in a Lucasfilm - designed Topps - style trading card mockup in December 2014 . A May 2015 Vanity Fair photo shoot by Annie Leibovitz confirmed that Driver would be portraying Kylo .   In an interview with Time , The Force Awakens costume designer Michael Kaplan said that Abrams requested that Ren 's mask be designed to be memorable for a child . After numerous attempts to gain Abrams ' approval , the final design was selected . Kaplan said :   I do n't know if it was the kind of spaghetti type lines on it or what , but the next time J.J. came by that was what we presented to him and he loved it ."", ""Title: Kylo Ren\nKylo Ren - wikipedia  Kylo Ren  Jump to : navigation , search `` Kylo '' redirects here .

After arriving at Jakku to retrieve a map containing the coordinates for the location of Luke Skywalker , Ren kills an old vicar known as Lor San Tekka and captures Resistance pilot Poe Dameron , who has also been sent to recover the map by General Leia Organa . Ren soon learns that the pilot had entrusted his astromech droid , BB - 8 , with the map . Poe flees with the help of rogue stormtrooper Finn , who later finds BB - 8 , and the scavenger Rey . Finn , Rey , and BB - 8 escape Jakku in the Millennium Falcon , and are soon intercepted by the ship 's former owner , Han Solo , and his co-pilot Chewbacca .   It is revealed that Ren is the son of Han and Leia , and was once one of Luke 's Jedi pupils . He was drawn to the dark side of the Force by the First Order 's Supreme Leader Snoke . He then helped to destroy his uncle Luke 's new Jedi Academy . However , Ren still feels the pull of the light side of the Force and seeks the strength to overcome this weakness from his grandfather Darth Vader , whose burnt helmet is in Ren 's possession . Arriving at the Maz Kanata castle , Ren captures Rey , who he senses has seen the map . While interrogating her with the Force , he realizes that she is strong with the Force herself , though unaware of it .

how many countries are a part of opec,"[""As of May 2017 , OPEC 's members are Algeria , Angola , Ecuador , Equatorial Guinea , Gabon , Iran , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Nigeria , Qatar , Saudi Arabia ( the de facto leader ) , United Arab Emirates , and Venezuela , while Indonesia is a former member . Two - thirds of OPEC 's oil production and reserves are in its six Middle Eastern countries that surround the oil - rich Persian Gulf .   The formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over natural resources , and OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the global oil market and international relations . The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply . In the 1970s , restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices and OPEC 's revenue and wealth , with long - lasting and far - reaching consequences for the global economy . In the 1980s , OPEC started setting production targets for its member nations ; and generally when the production targets are reduced , oil prices increase , most recently from the organization 's 2008 and 2016 decisions to trim oversupply .   Economists often cite OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel that cooperates to reduce market competition , but whose consultations are protected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law . In December 2014 , `` OPEC and the oil men '' ranked as # 3 on Lloyd 's list of `` the top 100 most influential people in the shipping industry '' . However , their influence on international trade is periodically challenged by the expansion of non-OPEC energy sources , and by the recurring temptation for individual OPEC countries to exceed production ceilings and pursue conflicting self - interests ."", ""According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , OPEC 's combined rate of oil production ( including gas condensate ) represented 44 percent of the world 's total in 2016 , and OPEC accounted for 73 percent of the world 's `` proven '' oil reserves , including 48 percent from just the six Middle Eastern members :   Approval of a new member country requires agreement by three - quarters of OPEC 's existing members , including all five of the founders .

Pulitzer Prize - winning war correspondent Ernie Pyle called the jeep , along with the Coleman G.I. Pocket Stove , `` the two most important pieces of noncombat equipment ever developed . '' Jeeps became even more famous following the war , as they became available on the surplus market . Some ads claimed to offer `` Jeeps still in the factory crate . '' This legend persisted for decades , despite the fact that Jeeps were never shipped from the factory in crates ( although Ford did `` knock down '' Jeeps for easier shipping , which may have perpetuated the myth ) .   The Jeepney is a unique type of taxi or bus created in the Philippines . The first Jeepneys were military - surplus MBs and GPWs , left behind in the war - ravaged country following World War II and Filipino independence . Jeepneys were built from Jeeps by lengthening and widening the rear `` tub '' of the vehicle , allowing them to carry more passengers . Over the years , Jeepneys have become the most ubiquitous symbol of the modern Philippines , even as they have been decorated in more elaborate and flamboyant styles by their owners . Most Jeepneys today are scratch - built by local manufacturers , using different powertrains . Some are even constructed from stainless steel .

ESPN named Sanders # 74 in its list of the 100 Great Athletes of the Century released in 1999 .   NFL.com named Sanders # 34 on NFL 's Top 100 list released in late 2010   On November 11 , 2010 , Sanders was inducted into the Atlanta Falcons ' Ring of Honor .   On February 5 , 2011 , Sanders was announced as a Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee in his first year of eligibility .   On May 17 , 2011 , Sanders was announced as a College Football Hall of Fame inductee .   On August 6 , 2011 , Sanders was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame .    Sanders also had a rushing TD in the playoffs ( against the Philadelphia Eagles in January 1996 ) . This makes him ( including post season ) one of only two players in NFL history ( Bill Dudley being the other ) to score a touchdown six different ways ( interception return , punt return , kickoff return , receiving , rushing , and a fumble recovery ) .   On February 6 , 2011 , at Super Bowl XLV in Arlington , Texas , Sanders performed the pre-game coin toss .   Sanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester of his senior year at Florida State , yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn . This caused the Florida State Legislature to create the ' Deion Sanders rule ' , whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester .   In 1995 , he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL 's salary cap . This caused the NFL to institute its own ' Deion Sanders rule ' whereby a prorated portion of a player 's signing bonus counted against the salary cap .

what is the name of manchester united stadium,"[""The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later . In October 1895 , before the visit of Manchester City , the club purchased a 2,000 - capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club , and put up another stand on the `` reserved side '' ( as distinct from the `` popular side '' ) . However , weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000 .   When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902 , club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club 's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham . Following financial investment , new club president John Henry Davies paid £ 500 for the erection of a new 1,000 - seat stand at Bank Street . Within four years , the stadium had cover on all four sides , as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators , some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand .   However , following Manchester United 's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later , it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ' ambition ; in February 1909 , six weeks before the club 's first FA Cup title , Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United , following the purchase of land for around £ 60,000 . Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £ 30,000 for construction ; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000 , though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000 . The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester . The stadium 's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939 , when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators .   Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium ; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter . After the war , the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £ 22,278 . While reconstruction took place , the team played its `` home '' games at Manchester City 's Maine Road ground ; Manchester United was charged £ 5,000 per year , plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts ."", ""Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium ; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter . After the war , the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £ 22,278 . While reconstruction took place , the team played its `` home '' games at Manchester City 's Maine Road ground ; Manchester United was charged £ 5,000 per year , plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts . Later improvements included the addition of roofs , first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands . The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans ' views , and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure . The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof , completed in time for the 1993 -- 94 season . First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £ 40,000 , four 180 - foot ( 55 m ) pylons were erected , each housing 54 individual floodlights . These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand , which remains in use today .   The Taylor Report 's requirement for an all - seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993 . In 1995 , the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers , restoring capacity to approximately 55,000 . At the end of the 1998 -- 99 season , second tiers were added to the East and West Stands , raising capacity to around 67,000 , and between July 2005 and May 2006 , 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north - west and north - east quadrants . Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006 , when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record . The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007 , when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4 -- 1 , with just 114 seats ( 0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212 ) unoccupied ."", ""United of Manchester . The West Stand of Old Trafford -- the `` Stretford End '' -- is the home end and the traditional source of the club 's most vocal support .   Rivalries  Main articles : Arsenal F.C. -- Manchester United F.C. rivalry , Manchester derby , Liverpool F.C. -- Manchester United F.C. rivalry , and Leeds United F.C. -- Manchester United F.C. rivalry  Manchester United has rivalries with Arsenal , Leeds United , Liverpool , and Manchester City , against whom they contest the Manchester derby .   The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port . Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and , at many points in their history , they have battled each other for the league title ( most recently in the 2008 -- 09 season ) . Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season .   The `` Roses Rivalry '' with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses , fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York , with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire .   The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams , as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger , have battled for the Premier League title . With 33 titles between them ( 20 for Manchester United , 13 for Arsenal ) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match - ups in history .   Global brand  Aeroflot is an official carrier of the club .  Manchester United has been described as a global brand ; a 2011 report by Brand Finance , valued the club 's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £ 412 million -- an increase of £ 39 million on the previous year , valuing it at £ 11 million more than the second best brand , Real Madrid -- and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA ( Extremely Strong ) . In July 2012 , Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands , valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion .

Williams Jr. and the all - star band returned , only this time they played in a `` juke joint '' set on a country road . The lead singer arrives in a GMC Yukon truck ( GMC paid for product placement ) with the license plate `` BOCEPHUS '' , which is Williams ' nickname . The Syndicate 's computer - generated tease was dropped and replaced by short pre-taped films focusing on a team or player in the game . Some of them have featured actor Jamie Foxx .   The guest visits continued : Barkley returned to the booth on September 17 in Philadelphia . Other guests throughout the season included Kimmel ( another returnee ) , Drew Carey , Miley Cyrus , Russell Crowe and Terry Bradshaw . In addition , Gordon was a halftime guest on the game just before the season - ending Ford 400 and was joined by teammate Jimmie Johnson .   At the end of each game , Williams returned to say , `` See you in ( city that is the site of the next week 's game ) . '' Both the open and close contain helmets of the participating teams , organized in the style of a concert poster .  2008 summary ( edit )  Despite the de-emphasis on entertainment on the overall telecast , ESPN did bring back Hank Williams , Jr. for his 20th season as part of the opening . This time , the opening sequence was set in a private residence . At the end of the song , Williams Jr. touched a foot pump , which supposedly contained the helmets of that night 's participating teams . The helmets were launched from the home toward the stadium at which the game was held . Through computer - generated imagery , the helmets `` land '' at midfield during a live shot , and then explode . The `` exploding helmets '' gimmick was also used at various times in the 1980s and 1990s during the pre-game tease . Williams Jr. then appeared again at the end of the game to promote the next week 's matchup .   ESPN also continued to promote upcoming albums through its use in bumper music ."", ""The 2006 telecast generally began with a cinematic tease produced by Rico Labbe , Michael Sciallis and Jason Jobes . It was during one of these teases that Barack Obama spoofed his announcement for the 2008 Presidential candidacy in favor of his hometown Chicago Bears in their game against the St. Louis Rams .   That year , the tease was followed by the show open produced by Los Angeles - based The Syndicate called `` Transformation '' . It features computer - generated imagery showing a city being transformed into a football stadium and passers - by on the street turning into players , coaches , fans and officials set to an updated orchestral treatment of the `` Heavy Action '' theme song . The sequence began every week with a different celebrity walking down the street , picking up a glowing football helmet with the ESPN logo on the side and saying , `` I 'm ready for some football ! Are you ? '' , thus beginning the transformation process . Celebrities for 2006 included Arnold Schwarzenegger , Matthew Fox , Hugh Hefner , Paris Hilton , Spike Lee , Ashton Kutcher , Samuel L.

who wrote cant get you out of my head lyrics,"[""Jointly written , composed , and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' is a midtempo dance - pop song which lyrically details its narrator 's obsession towards her lover . The song is famous for its `` la la la '' hook .   In addition to positive reviews from music critics , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' found commercial success on a large scale . It peaked at number one on the charts of Austria , Belgium , France , Germany , Italy , Poland , Switzerland , the United Kingdom , and every other European country excluding Finland . It also topped the charts of Minogue 's native country Australia , Canada and New Zealand . In the United States , the song peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart , becoming Minogue 's biggest hit in the region since `` The Loco - Motion '' . `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' reportedly reached number one in 40 countries across the globe . It was certified triple - platinum in Australia , double - platinum in the United Kingdom , and gold in the United States . It became Minogue 's first single to sell in excess of one million copies in the United Kingdom , where it also stands as the 28th best - selling single of the millennium . As of 2013 , the song was Minogue 's highest selling single and one of the best - selling singles of all time , with worldwide sales exceeding five million .   The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Dawn Shadforth , and featured Minogue performing various dance routines in different futuristic backdrops . It became notable for the revealing hooded white jumpsuit Minogue wore during one of the scenes . The song has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours as of 2017 , with the exception of the Anti Tour . Following its release , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' ranked on a number of decade - end lists compiled by magazines such as Rolling Stone , The Guardian , and NME . It is considered to be Minogue 's strongest commercial breakthrough in the United States and is said to have been the reason behind the success of its parent album Fever in the region ."", ""She promoted the album by embarking on the On a Night Like This tour . Minogue premiered `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' by performing it during the tour , and soon after , discussion regarding the song `` quickly set online messageboards alight . '' `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was chosen as the lead single from Minogue 's eighth studio album , Fever , and it was released on 8 September 2001 by Parlophone in Australia , while in the United Kingdom and other European countries it was released on 17 September .  My A&R at the time , Miles Leonard and Jamie Nelson , said , `` We 've got something . Come into the office . We 've got to play you something . '' So I went to the EMI office , and I had the same reaction you did , about 20 seconds in . I could n't even fathom what I was hearing . It just ... did something . I was beside myself . Then at the end of the song , panic set in . I was saying `` Are you sure we 've got this song ? Do n't tell me that we do n't ! Is it secured ? Can we have it ? '' And we did ! And that kick - started a whole different phase in my career .  -- Minogue , about her reaction to hearing the demo of the song .   `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was jointly written , composed , and produced by Cathy Dennis and Rob Davis . Dennis and Davis had been brought together by British artist manager Simon Fuller , who wanted the duo to come up with a song for British pop group S Club 7 . The song was recorded using Cubase music software , which Davis ran on his Mac computer . Davis began playing an acoustic guitar and ran a 125 beats per minute drum loop , on which Dennis , herself a singer who had enjoyed chart success in the United States , began singing the line `` I just ca n't get you out of my head '' in the key of D minor . After three and a half hours , the demo was recorded and the vocals were laid afterwards . Dennis called their recording setup for the song `` the most primitive set - up you could imagine ! Different producers work in different ways ."", ""'' Similarly , Everett True from The Guardian wrote that the song continued the `` change in the marketing and public perception of Kylie '' and her transition from the `` homely girl - next - door '' to `` a much more flirtatious , sophisticated persona '' that started with the release of `` Spinning Around '' in 2000 . True also felt that the success of `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' was one of the motivating factors behind `` manufactured '' pop music gaining a `` new postmodern respectability '' and marked a `` clear shift in attitude towards pop music among the ' serious ' rock critic fraternity : the idea that ( manufactured , female ) pop music might well be the equal of ( organic , male ) rock music after all , that each has their high points and their low . '' In 2011 , Minogue 's official website posted a special article marking the song 's 10th anniversary on 8 September , the release date of `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' in Australia . `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' is recognised as Minogue 's signature song .   `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' garnered Minogue a number of awards . At the 2001 Top of the Pops Awards ceremony , the song won the award for `` Best Single . '' At the 2002 ARIA Music Awards ceremony , `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' won the awards for `` Single of the Year '' and `` Highest Selling Single , '' and Minogue won the `` Outstanding Achievement Award . '' In 2002 , it won a Dutch Edison Award for `` Single of the Year . '' In the same year , Dennis and Davis won three awards at the 47th Ivor Novello Awards for their composition of the song ; they won the awards `` The Ivors Dance Award , '' `` Most Performed Work , '' and `` International Hit of the Year . '' At the inaugural Premios Oye ! in 2002 , the song received a nomination in the category of `` Song of the Year . '' In the 2007 episode of The Simpsons , `` Homerazzi '' , the track is heard playing in a celebrity - packed nightclub into which Homer storms .

who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"[""He is dethroned by the spectre of an actor , and we shall never be able to keep the usurper out of our dreams .  Maurice Maeterlinck in La Jeune Belgique ( 1890 ) .   Shakespeare 's day to the Interregnum ( edit )   Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage . He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range . Judging by the number of reprints , Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare 's fourth most popular play during his lifetime -- only Henry IV Part 1 , Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it . Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set ; however , as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets , this would not have affected the staging .   Firm evidence for specific early performances of the play is scant . What is known is that the crew of the ship Red Dragon , anchored off Sierra Leone , performed Hamlet in September 1607 ; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare 's death ; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637 . Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that , since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet ( only Falstaff is mentioned more , from Shakespeare ) , the play was surely performed with a frequency that the historical record misses .   All theatres were closed down by the Puritan government during the Interregnum . Even during this time , however , playlets known as drolls were often performed illegally , including one called The Grave - Makers based on Act 5 , Scene 1 of Hamlet .   Restoration and 18th century ( edit )  Title page and frontispiece for Hamlet , Prince of Denmark : A Tragedy . As it is now acted at the Theatres - Royal in Drury - Lane and Covent - Garden . London , 1776  The play was revived early in the Restoration . When the existing stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies , Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant 's Duke 's Company secured ."", ""In 1748 , Alexander Sumarokov wrote a Russian adaptation that focused on Prince Hamlet as the embodiment of an opposition to Claudius 's tyranny -- a treatment that would recur in Eastern European versions into the 20th century . In the years following America 's independence , Thomas Apthorpe Cooper , the young nation 's leading tragedian , performed Hamlet among other plays at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia , and at the Park Theatre in New York . Although chided for `` acknowledging acquaintances in the audience '' and `` inadequate memorisation of his lines '' , he became a national celebrity .   19th century ( edit )  A poster , ca . 1884 , for an American production of Hamlet ( starring Thomas W. Keene ) , showing several of the key scenes  From around 1810 to 1840 , the best - known Shakespearean performances in the United States were tours by leading London actors -- including George Frederick Cooke , Junius Brutus Booth , Edmund Kean , William Charles Macready , and Charles Kemble . Of these , Booth remained to make his career in the States , fathering the nation 's most notorious actor , John Wilkes Booth ( who later assassinated Abraham Lincoln ) , and its most famous Hamlet , Edwin Booth . Edwin Booth 's Hamlet at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in 1875 was described as `` ... the dark , sad , dreamy , mysterious hero of a poem. ... ( acted ) in an ideal manner , as far removed as possible from the plane of actual life '' . Booth played Hamlet for 100 nights in the 1864 / 5 season at The Winter Garden Theatre , inaugurating the era of long - run Shakespeare in America .   In the United Kingdom , the actor - managers of the Victorian era ( including Kean , Samuel Phelps , Macready , and Henry Irving ) staged Shakespeare in a grand manner , with elaborate scenery and costumes . The tendency of actor - managers to emphasise the importance of their own central character did not always meet with the critics ' approval . George Bernard Shaw 's praise for Johnston Forbes - Robertson 's performance contains a sideswipe at Irving : `` The story of the play was perfectly intelligible , and quite took the attention of the audience off the principal actor at moments . What is the Lyceum coming to ? ''"", ""He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century .   Three different early versions of the play are extant : the First Quarto ( Q1 , 1603 ) ; the Second Quarto ( Q2 , 1604 ) ; and the First Folio ( F1 , 1623 ) . Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others . The play 's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny . One such example is the centuries - old debate about Hamlet 's hesitation to kill his uncle , which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action , but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold - blooded murder , calculated revenge , and thwarted desire . More recently , psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet 's unconscious desires , while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude .""]","[""The story of Shakespeare's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet we now have.

where does the story the great gatsby take place,"[""Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby 's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald 's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby 's fortune . Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book 's plotline within the historical context of the era .   Fitzgerald 's visits to Long Island 's north shore and his experience attending parties at mansions inspired The Great Gatsby 's setting . Today , there are a number of theories as to which mansion was the inspiration for the book . One possibility is Land 's End , a notable Gold Coast Mansion where Fitzgerald may have attended a party . Many of the events in Fitzgerald 's early life are reflected throughout The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald was a young man from Minnesota , and like Nick , he was educated at an Ivy League school , Princeton ( in Nick 's case , Yale ) . Fitzgerald is also similar to Jay Gatsby , in that he fell in love while stationed far from home in the military and fell into a life of decadence trying to prove himself to the girl he loved . Fitzgerald became a second lieutenant , and was stationed at Camp Sheridan , in Montgomery , Alabama . There he met and fell in love with a wild seventeen - year - old beauty named Zelda Sayre . Zelda finally agreed to marry him , but her preference for wealth , fun , and leisure led her to delay their wedding until he could prove a success . Like Nick in The Great Gatsby , Fitzgerald found this new lifestyle seductive and exciting , and , like Gatsby , he had always idolized the very rich . In many ways , The Great Gatsby represents Fitzgerald 's attempt to confront his conflicting feelings about the Jazz Age . Like Gatsby , Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted , even as she led him toward everything he despised .   In her book Careless People : Murder , Mayhem and the Invention of ' The Great Gatsby ( 2013 ) , Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall - Mills Case ."", ""Title: The Great Gatsby\nThe Great Gatsby - Wikipedia  The Great Gatsby  Jump to : navigation , search This article is about the novel .

Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922 . The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan . Considered to be Fitzgerald 's magnum opus , The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence , idealism , resistance to change , social upheaval , and excess , creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream .   Fitzgerald -- inspired by the parties he had attended while visiting Long Island 's north shore -- began planning the novel in 1923 , desiring to produce , in his words , `` something new -- something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned . '' Progress was slow , with Fitzgerald completing his first draft following a move to the French Riviera in 1924 . His editor , Maxwell Perkins , felt the book was vague and persuaded the author to revise over the following winter . Fitzgerald was repeatedly ambivalent about the book 's title and he considered a variety of alternatives , including titles that referenced the Roman character Trimalchio ; the title he was last documented to have desired was Under the Red , White , and Blue .   First published by Scribner 's in April 1925 , The Great Gatsby received mixed reviews and sold poorly ; in its first year , the book sold only 20,000 copies ."", ""The play failed miserably , and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production . The stories were , in his words , `` all trash and it nearly broke my heart , '' although included among those stories was `` Winter Dreams '' , which Fitzgerald later described as `` a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea '' .   After the birth of their child , the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck , New York , on Long Island , in October 1922 . The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald 's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner , actor Lew Fields , and comedian Ed Wynn . These figures were all considered to be `` new money '' , unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula , places which were home to many of New York 's wealthiest established families , and which sat across the bay from Great Neck . This real - life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for `` West Egg '' and `` East Egg '' . In this novel , Great Neck ( King 's Point ) became the `` new money '' peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington ( Sands Point ) the old - money East Egg . Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby 's home , such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers , since demolished .   By mid-1923 , Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel but discarded most of his new story as a false start , some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story `` Absolution '' .   Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924 . Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger , `` Out of woods at last and starting novel . '' He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a `` consciously artistic achievement '' and a `` purely creative work -- not trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world . '' He added later , during editing , that he felt `` an enormous power in me now , more than I 've ever had . '' Soon after this burst of inspiration , work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera , where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed .""]","[""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.

what purpose did seasonal monsoon winds have on trade,"['A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone . When located within a monsoon region , this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough . Around 30 ° in both hemispheres , air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high - pressure belts known as subtropical ridges . The subsident ( sinking ) air is relatively dry because as it descends , the temperature increases , but the absolute humidity remains constant , which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass . This warm , dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical ( warm and moist ) air mass . An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion . When it occurs within a trade wind regime , it is known as a trade wind inversion .   The surface air that flows from these subtropical high - pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect . These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere . Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing , these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere . The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums .   As they blow across tropical regions , air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight . Those that develop over land ( continental ) are drier and hotter than those that develop over oceans ( maritime ) , and travel northward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge . Maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses . The one region of the Earth which has an absence of trade winds is the north Indian ocean .   Weather effects ( edit )   Clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres ( 13,000 ft ) in height , and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion .', ""The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the sea '' but also `` return from the sea '' ) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around 30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation , which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta 's voyage in 1565 .   The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all .   By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England 's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of ' trade ' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world 's oceans .

See also : Air mass , Hadley cell , Humidity , Intertropical Convergence Zone , Monsoon , Monsoon trough , Near - equatorial trough , and Prevailing winds  As part of the Hadley cell circulation , surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles . A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone .""]","[""The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics, within the lower portion of the Earth's atmosphere, in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth's equator. The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere, strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase. Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world's oceans for centuries, and enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.""]","The sources provided do not specifically mention the role of seasonal monsoon winds in trade. However, historically, seasonal monsoon winds have been crucial for trade, especially in the Indian Ocean region. These winds allowed for predictable sailing conditions, enabling traders to travel between regions such as the Arabian Peninsula, India, and Southeast Asia. The monsoon winds facilitated the movement of goods, people, and cultural exchanges, significantly impacting trade routes and economic interactions in these areas.",enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans

when is the next deadpool movie being released,"[""Noting the release date , Leitch wanted to ensure that the film `` was worthy of a summer tentpole movie , and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films '' , specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film `` bigger '' than the first one . However , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '' of combining that with the increased scope . The film uses Deadpool 's fourth wall - breaking to reference this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh and timely when they come up . '' In May 2017 , Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool 2 to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds , Brolin , and Beetz in an X-Force film . Casting for the characters -- Sunspot , Feral , and Shatterstar -- would take place over the coming months , though Reese denied the accuracy of this report . Later , T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return from the first film as Weasel , and described the sequel as `` even more weaselicious '' than the first . He noted that Reynolds and the writers had `` really put the time in on the script '' to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans . Jack Kesy also joined the cast , as Black Tom Cassidy . In June , Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film .   Filming   Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films . Principal photography began in Vancouver on June 26 , under the working title Love Machine . Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film . At the end of June , Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film . The next month , T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film , and that `` it 's not going to be the same movie in a different location ( like The Hangover Part II ) ."", ""Tim 's brilliant and nobody worked harder on Deadpool than he did . '' A week after Miller 's departure , Fox was looking at David Leitch , Drew Goddard , Magnus Martens , and Rupert Sanders as potential replacements for the director . Leitch was the `` strong frontrunner '' for the role , and signed on to direct a month later . Reynolds , a fan of Leitch 's John Wick , said the director `` really understands those Deadpool sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise from here . '' He added that Leitch `` can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10 -- 15 times what it cost . ''   Pre-production   Reese and Wernick had completed multiple drafts of the script by January 2017 , saying , `` It 's taken different twists and turns , but it 's really coalescing '' ; the film was still on track to begin filming that year . The pair felt a responsibility to explore the team X-Force , which includes Deadpool , Cable , and Domino in the comics , with Reese saying the sequel 's purpose `` is not to set up X-Force ( but ) it will likely set up X-Force . '' He did clarify that though the film will be `` populated with a lot of characters ... it is still Deadpool 's movie '' . The pair confirmed that Stefan Kapičić 's Colossus , Brianna Hildebrand 's Negasonic Teenage Warhead , and Karan Soni 's Dopinder would be returning from the first film to `` make at least an appearance '' , and that the film would not be exploring the details of Cable 's convoluted comic origins . By the next month , it had been noted that there had been few announcements from Fox regarding the film , and that a release date had not yet been set which was seen as unusual for sequels to popular films ( often studios `` announce sequels far too soon and with no idea what will happen '' ) , with the issue deemed to be the film 's script . Reynolds , Reese , and Wernick had been `` bunkered down , working on the script together , trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make '' . At that time , Goddard joined the project to consult on the script .""]","['Deadpool 2 is scheduled to be released in the United States on May 18, 2018.

the south west wind blows across nigeria between,"[""The sun 's rays enters into the atmosphere of Nigeria more intense than it does during the presence of the Tropical continental airmass , which contained dust ( in form of haze ) that reduced the intensity of the sun . The overheating of the west Africa land mass and Nigeria in particular creates a low pressure region over west Africa and Nigeria . This low pressure zone attracts the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) from the south Atlantic Ocean since areas of low pressures experiences inward blowing winds because winds are moving air blowing outwards from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure .   The Tropical Maritime Airmass is a warm humid and unstable trade wind due to its warmth . Convectional currents are easily set up within the airmass whenever there is little instability in the airmass as a result of a slight to a very high orographic uplift in mountainous regions like the obudu plateau or the heating of the land which can trigger the formation of cumulonimbus cloud leading to thunderstorms within the airmass .   During the dominance of the Tropical Maritime Airmass ( MT ) in the rainy season of Nigeria , mornings are bright and sunny , the sun 's heating of the land in the mornings and afternoons sets up convectional currents , these currents rise vertically and cumulonimbus clouds are formed , by afternoons to evenings , torrential downpour follows .   The Easterly wave or the African easterly waves is another major contributor of rainfall during the summer monsoons months of May to September in Nigeria .   The nature of this waves changes at about the 15 degrees line . The waves that pass south of this line carry moisture and create convection that leads to rain clouds . Nigeria 's northern end is south of the 15 degrees line at about 14 degrees . Nigeria 's location in the wetter part of the easterly waves south of the 15 degree line creates wetter climatic conditions for Nigeria especially during the monsoons .   Tropical continental airmass ( edit )   The Tropical Continental Airmass ( CT ) locally known as the harmattan , is a wind originating from North Africa which crosses the Sahara Desert into west Africa to Nigeria . This airmass dominates Nigeria 's climate during the dry season from December to March ."", ""Due to their location in the tropics , this elevation is high enough to reach the temperate climate line in the tropics thereby giving the highlands , mountains and the plateau regions standing above this height , a cool mountain climate .   Seasons ( edit )   Nigeria , like the rest of West Africa and other tropical lands , has only two seasons . These are the dry season and the rainy season . The dry season is accompanied by a dust laden airmass from the Sahara Desert , locally known as Harmattan , or by its main name , The Tropical Continental ( CT ) airmass , while the rainy season is heavily influenced by an airmass originating from the south atlantic ocean , locally known as the south west wind , or by its main name , The Tropical Maritime ( MT ) airmass . These two major wind systems in Nigeria are known as the trade winds .   Trade winds ( edit )   Tropical Maritime airmass ( edit )   The tropical maritime airmass ( MT ) is responsible for Nigeria 's rainy season . This wind ( the tropical maritime airmass ) invades the country from February in the southern part of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country , reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June . Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat , of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) known as the harmattan . The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass ( CT ) , is caused by the sun 's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere . This shift begins from February and ends in June , when the sun is fully overhead , at the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   During this northward migration of the sun as a result of the earth tilting along its axis , the sun crosses the equator ( around March ) , moving over west Africa at this time on its journey to the northern hemisphere . West Africa comes directly under the sun at this time . The sun is overhead throughout west Africa and over Nigeria during this period of the sun 's northward migration to the tropic of cancer in the northern hemisphere .   The whole of West Africa is heated intensely as result of the increased insolation received from the sun being overhead over west Africa .""]","['With the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) swinging northward over West Africa from the Southern Hemisphere in April, heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of squall lines also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical(south westerlies) and the Continental tropical(north easterlies),[4] begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity, heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria.Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from 1,100 mm (43.3 in) in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over 2,000 mm (78.7 in) along the south western escarpment of the Jos Plateau.[5]', 'With the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) swinging northward over West Africa from the Southern Hemisphere in April, heavy showers coming from pre-monsoonal convective clouds mainly in the form of squall lines also known as the north easterlies formed mainly as a result of the interactions of the two dominant airmasses in Nigeria known as the Maritime tropical(south westerlies) and the Continental tropical(north easterlies),[4] begins in central Nigeria while the Monsoons from the south atlantic ocean arrives in central Nigeria in July bringing with it high humidity, heavy cloud cover and heavy rainfall which can be daily occurrence lasting till September when the monsoons gradually begin retreating southward to the southern part of Nigeria.Rainfall totals in central Nigeria varies from 1,100 mm (43.3 in) in the lowlands of the river Niger Benue trough to over 2,000 mm (78.7 in) along the south western escarpment of the Jos Plateau.[5]']","The south west wind, also known as the Tropical Maritime (MT) airmass, begins to invade Nigeria from February in the southern part and takes longer to cover the whole country, reaching the northern part by June.",arrives in central Nigeria in July

who wrote the first declaration of human rights,"[""Kuhrt comments that `` the purely Babylonian context of the Cylinder provides no proof '' of the historicity of Cyrus 's return of the Jewish exiles and the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem , though Becking links this with the lack of any references to the Jews in surviving Achaemenid texts -- an indication that the Persians seem not to have regarded them as being of any great importance .   The German scholar Josef Wiesehöfer summarizes the widely held traditional view by noting that `` Many scholars have read into ( ... ) sentences ( from the text of Cylinder ) a confirmation of the Old Testament passages about the steps taken by Cyrus towards the erection of the Jerusalem temple and the repatriation of the Judaeans '' and this interpretation was , according to Wiesehöfer , for some scholars a strict belief `` that the instructions to this effect were actually provided in these very formulations of the Cyrus Cylinder . ''   Human rights ( edit )   The Cylinder gained new prominence in the late 1960s when the last Shah of Iran called it `` the world 's first charter of human rights '' .

The Shah identified Cyrus as a key figure in government ideology and associated his government with the Achaemenids . He wrote that `` the history of our empire began with the famous declaration of Cyrus , which , for its advocacy of humane principles , justice and liberty , must be considered one of the most remarkable documents in the history of mankind .

In 1968 , the Shah opened the first United Nations Conference on Human Rights in Tehran by saying that the Cyrus Cylinder was the precursor to the modern Universal Declaration of Human Rights .   In his 1971 Nowruz ( New Year ) speech , the Shah declared that 1971 would be Cyrus the Great Year , during which a grand commemoration would be held to celebrate 2,500 years of Persian monarchy . It would serve as a showcase for a modern Iran in which the contributions that Iran had made to world civilization would be recognized . The main theme of the commemoration was the centrality of the monarchy within Iran 's political system , associating the Shah of Iran with the famous monarchs of Persia 's past , and with Cyrus in particular . The Shah looked to the Achaemenid period as `` a moment from the national past that could best serve as a model and a slogan for the imperial society he hoped to create . ''   The Cyrus Cylinder was adopted as the symbol for the commemoration , and Iranian magazines and journals published numerous articles about ancient Persian history . The British Museum loaned the original Cylinder to the Iranian government for the duration of the festivities ; it was put on display at the Shahyad Monument ( now the Azadi Tower ) in Tehran . The 2,500 year celebrations commenced on October 12 , 1971 and culminated a week later with a spectacular parade at the tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadae . On October 14 , the shah 's sister , Princess Ashraf Pahlavi , presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder . The princess asserted that `` the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding , tolerance , courage , compassion and , above all , human liberty '' . The Secretary General accepted the gift , linking the Cylinder with the efforts of the United Nations General Assembly to address `` the question of Respect for Human Rights in Armed Conflict '' . Since then the replica Cylinder has been kept at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City on the second floor hallway . The United Nations continues to promote the cylinder as `` an ancient declaration of human rights . ''""]","['The Cylinder\'s text has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of Cyrus\' policy of the repatriation of the Jewish people following their Babylonian captivity[4] (an act that the Book of Ezra attributes to Cyrus[5]), as the text refers to the restoration of cult sanctuaries and repatriation of deported peoples.[6] This interpretation has been disputed, as the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries, and makes no mention of Jews, Jerusalem, or Judea.[7] The Cylinder has also been referred to by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran as the first declaration of universal human rights, a view rejected by some historians as anachronistic and a misunderstanding of the Cylinder\'s generic nature as a typical statement made by a new monarch at the beginning of his reign.[8][9][10][11][12][13] Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, has stated that the cylinder was ""the first attempt we know about running a society, a state with different nationalities and faiths—a new kind of statecraft.""[14] It was adopted as a national symbol of Iran by the Imperial State which put it on display in Tehran in 1971 to commemorate 2,500 year celebration of the Persian Empire.[15] On October 14, the Mohammad Reza Shah\'s sister, Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, presented the United Nations Secretary General U Thant with a replica of the Cylinder. The princess asserted that ""the heritage of Cyrus was the heritage of human understanding, tolerance, courage, compassion and, above all, human liberty"".[16]']","The Cyrus Cylinder is often referred to as the ""first declaration of human rights.""

what happens to the rbc in acute hemolytic reaction,"[""Title: Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction\nAcute hemolytic transfusion reaction - wikipedia  Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction  Jump to : navigation , search      This article may be too technical for most readers to understand . Please help improve it to make it understandable to non-experts , without removing the technical details . ( January 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message )     An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction ( AHTR ) is a type of transfusion reaction that is associated with hemolysis . It occurs very soon after the transfusion , and within 24 hrs post-transfusion . It can occur quickly upon transfusing a few milliliters , or up to 1 -- 2 hours post-transfusion .   It is also known as an `` immediate hemolytic transfusion reaction '' . This is a medical emergency as it results from rapid destruction of the donor red blood cells by host antibodies ( IgG , IgM ) . It is usually related to ABO blood group incompatibility - the most severe of which often involves group A red cells being given to a patient with group O type blood . Properdin then binds to complement C3 in the donor blood , facilitating the reaction through the alternate pathway cascade . The donor cells also become coated with IgG and are subsequently removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . Jaundice and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) may also occur . The most common cause is clerical error ( i.e. the wrong unit of blood being given to the patient ) ."", ""The former results in a severe intravascular hemolysis and the latter typically causes extravascular hemolysis . The reactions are mediated by cytokines like TNF , IL - 8 , monocyte chemoattractant protein , IL - 1 etc .

Diagnosis ( edit )   Differential diagnoses ( edit )    Disseminated intravascular coagulation   Hemolytic anemia   Pulmonary edema   Septic shock    Management ( edit )    In case of antibody - mediated acute hemolytic transfusion reactions ,   Immediately discontinue the transfusion while maintaining venous access for emergency management .   Anticipate low blood pressure , kidney failure , and DIC .   Prophylactic measures to reduce the risk of renal failure may include low - dose dopamine , vigorous hydration with intravenous crystalloid solutions ( e.g. , lactated Ringer 's solution or normal saline ) , and osmotic diuresis with mannitol .   If DIC is documented and bleeding requires treatment , transfusions of frozen plasma , pooled cryoprecipitates for fibrinogen , and / or platelet concentrates may be indicated .     In case of non-antibody mediated AHR   This does not require rigorous management .   Diuresis induced by an infusion of normal saline until the intense red color of hemoglobinuria ceases is usually adequate treatment .

who designed the garden city of new earswick,"[""There was housing for both workers and managers , in a green setting with gardens for each home with its own 2 fruit trees . It was founded by the York philanthropist , Joseph Rowntree , who was quoted as saying , `` I do not want to establish communities bearing the stamp of charity but rather of rightly ordered and self governing communities '' . The first 28 houses were built between 1902 and 1904 by the architect Raymond Unwin , after which the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust ( now the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust ) was established to continue building and manage the new village . The Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust is part of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation .   The village had contemporaries such as Bournville , Saltaire , Port Sunlight and others . This was in sharp contrast to the slums that had developed in York and other cities during the previous century , the deprivation of which had been revealed in Seebohm Rowntree 's report of 1901 , entitled Poverty : a study of town life . It revealed appalling statistics of dark , overcrowded and insanitary housing .   As a result of the report , Joseph Rowntree 's conviction that it must be possible to provide better housing for people on low incomes led him to acquire 150 acres of land near the village of Earswick , two and a half miles to the north of the centre of York . The planner Raymond Unwin and the architect Barry Parker were commissioned to produce an overall plan for a new ' garden ' village and the detailed designs for its first houses . They also designed the garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City .   The building of New Earswick created a balanced village community where rents were kept low , but still represented a modest commercial return on the capital invested . Houses were open to any working people , not just Rowntree employees . The village was to be a demonstration of good practice .   The Trust Deed of the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust , which was set up in 1904 to build and manage New Earswick , safeguarded generous open green space . All the grass verges were planted with trees after which almost all the roads are named . The village was built with bricks that were made in the brickworks on the outskirts of New Earswick ."", ""Title: New Earswick\nNew Earswick - wikipedia  New Earswick  Jump to : navigation , search    New Earswick     New Earswick New Earswick shown within North Yorkshire     Population   2,737 ( 2011 )     OS grid reference   SE609555     Civil parish     New Earswick       Unitary authority     City of York       Ceremonial county     North Yorkshire       Region     Yorkshire and the Humber       Country   England     Sovereign state   United Kingdom     Post town   YORK     Postcode district   YO32     Dialling code   01904         Police   North Yorkshire     Fire   North Yorkshire     Ambulance   Yorkshire         EU Parliament   Yorkshire and the Humber     UK Parliament     York Outer         List of places   UK   England   Yorkshire   53 ° 59 ′ 31 '' N 1 ° 04 ′ 21 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 53.992020 ° N 1.072380 ° W \ufeff / 53.992020 ; - 1.072380 Coordinates : 53 ° 59 ′ 31 '' N 1 ° 04 ′ 21 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 53.992020 ° N 1.072380 ° W \ufeff / 53.992020 ; - 1.072380     New Earswick is a model village and civil parish in the unitary authority of City of York in North Yorkshire , England , near the River Foss , north of York and south of Haxby .

Charles Darwin himself wrote in his Origin of Species , that the evolution of the eye by natural selection seemed at first glance `` absurd in the highest possible degree '' . However , he went on that despite the difficulty in imagining it , its evolution was perfectly feasible :   ... if numerous gradations from a simple and imperfect eye to one complex and perfect can be shown to exist , each grade being useful to its possessor , as is certainly the case ; if further , the eye ever varies and the variations be inherited , as is likewise certainly the case and if such variations should be useful to any animal under changing conditions of life , then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection , though insuperable by our imagination , should not be considered as subversive of the theory .   He suggested a stepwise evolution from `` an optic nerve merely coated with pigment , and without any other mechanism '' to `` a moderately high stage of perfection '' , and gave examples of existing intermediate steps . Darwin 's suggestions were soon shown to be correct , and current research is investigating the genetic mechanisms underlying eye development and evolution .   Biologist D.E. Nilsson has independently theorized about four general stages in the evolution of a vertebrate eye from a patch of photoreceptors . Nilsson and S. Pelger estimated in a classical paper how many generations are needed to evolve a complex eye in vertebrates . Another researcher , G.C. Young , has used the fossil record to infer evolutionary conclusions , based on the structure of eye orbits and openings in fossilized skulls for blood vessels and nerves to go through . All this adds to the growing amount of evidence that supports Darwin 's theory .   Rate of evolution ( edit )   The first fossils of eyes found to date are from the lower Cambrian period ( about 540 million years ago ) . The lower Cambrian had a burst of apparently rapid evolution , called the `` Cambrian explosion '' ."", ""Title: Evolution of the eye\nEvolution of the eye - wikipedia  Evolution of the eye  Jump to : navigation , search Major stages in the evolution of the eye in vertebrates .  The evolution of the eye is attractive to study , because the eye distinctively exemplifies an analogous organ found in many animal forms . Complex , image - forming eyes have evolved independently several times . The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion . According his theory , the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells ( so called Pax 6 genes ) appeared probably at once in the life history , at a very early stage of the evolution . Probably , the complex , image forming kinds of eyes are at least five : Chidaria - lens eye , complex eye ; Molluscs - lens eye , everse retina ; Annelids - lens eye , everse retina ; Arthropods - facet eye ; Vertebrate - lens eye , inverse retina   Complex eyes appeared first within the few million years of the Cambrian explosion . From before the Cambrian , no evidence of eyes has survived , but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian , and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale . Eyes are adapted to the various requirements of their owners . They vary in their visual acuity , the range of wavelengths they can detect , their sensitivity in low light , their ability to detect motion or to resolve objects , and whether they can discriminate colours .

where is gall bladder situated in human body,"['It rotates a further 180 degrees after it has moved back into the abdomen . This process creates the twisted shape of the large intestine .   Function ( edit )   Food from the stomach is allowed into the duodenum through the pylorus by a muscle called the pyloric sphincter .   Digestion ( edit )   The small intestine is where most chemical digestion takes place . Many of the digestive enzymes that act in the small intestine are secreted by the pancreas and liver and enter the small intestine via the pancreatic duct . Pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder enter the small intestine in response to the hormone cholecystokinin , which is produced in the small intestine in response to the presence of nutrients . Secretin , another hormone produced in the small intestine , causes additional effects on the pancreas , where it promotes the release of bicarbonate into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach .   The three major classes of nutrients that undergo digestion are proteins , lipids ( fats ) and carbohydrates :    Proteins are degraded into small peptides and amino acids before absorption . Chemical breakdown begins in the stomach and continues in the small intestine . Proteolytic enzymes , including trypsin and chymotrypsin , are secreted by the pancreas and cleave proteins into smaller peptides . Carboxypeptidase , which is a pancreatic brush border enzyme , splits one amino acid at a time . Aminopeptidase and dipeptidase free the end amino acid products .   Lipids ( fats ) are degraded into fatty acids and glycerol . Pancreatic lipase breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides . Pancreatic lipase works with the help of the salts from the bile secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder . Bile salts attach to triglycerides to help emulsify them , which aids access by pancreatic lipase . This occurs because the lipase is water - soluble but the fatty triglycerides are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards each other and away from the watery intestinal surroundings . The bile salts emulsify the triglycerides in the watery surroundings until the lipase can break them into the smaller components that are able to enter the villi for absorption .', ""Such polyps often cause no symptoms and so are often detected in this way .   Tests ( edit )  An ultrasound showing the gallbladder ( central dark area ) with a large gallstone ( white circular area found near the middle ) .  Tests used to investigate for gallbladder disease include blood tests and medical imaging . A full blood count may reveal an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection . Tests such as bilirubin and liver function tests may reveal if there is inflammation linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder , and whether this is associated with inflammation of the liver , and a lipase or amylase may be elvated if there is pancreatitis . Bilirubin may rise when there is obstruction of the flow of bile . A CA 19 - 9 level may be taken to investigate for cholangiocarcinoma .   Ultrasound is often the first medical imaging test performed when gallbladder disease such as gallstones are suspected . An abdominal X-ray or CT scan is another form of imaging that may be used to examine the gallbladder and surrounding organs . Other imaging options include MRCP ( magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ) , ERCP and percutaneous or intraoperative cholangiography . A cholescintigraphy scan is a nuclear imaging procedure used to assess the condition of the gallbladder .   Society and Culture ( edit )   To have ' gall ' is associated with bold behaviour , whereas to have ' bile ' is associated with bitterness .   In the Chinese language , the gallbladder ( Chinese : 膽 ) is associated with courage and a myriad of related idioms , including using terms such as `` a body completely ( of ) gall '' ( Chinese : 渾身 是 膽 ) to describe a brave person , and `` single gallbladder hero '' ( Chinese : 孤膽 英雄 ) to describe a lone hero .   In the Zangfu theory of Chinese medicine , the gallbladder not only has a digestive role , but is seen as the seat of decision - making .   Other animals ( edit )   Most vertebrates have gallbladders , but the form and arrangement of the bile ducts may vary considerably . In many species , for example , there are several separate ducts running to the intestine , rather than the single common bile duct found in humans .""]","['In vertebrates, the gallbladder is a small hollow organ where bile is stored and concentrated before it is released into the small intestine.

An earlier African Footballer of the Year Golden Ball award was given out between 1970 and 1994 by France Football magazine . The changes resulted in parallel Golden Ball awards given out to Abedi Pele and George Weah in 1993 and 1994 by the magazine although the CAF sponsored awards for those years were won respectively by Rashidi Yekini and Emmanuel Amuneke , as well as two awards given to Abedi Pelé in 1992 . France Football discontinued the election from 1995 after the European Ballon d'Or -- also awarded by the magazine -- had been opened to all players in the European leagues .   On 2 February 2008 , Sevilla 's Frédéric Kanouté was named the 2007 African Footballer of the Year . Kanouté , who was born in France , is the first European - born player to win the award ( he plays for his father 's native country of Mali ) .

what is the main mineral in lithium batteries,"[""Li would therefore have a content of up to 96.25 % .       view   talk     references in Wikidata     Lithium ( from Greek : λίθος , translit . lithos , lit . ' stone ' ) is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3 . It is a soft , silvery - white alkali metal . Under standard conditions , it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element . Like all alkali metals , lithium is highly reactive and flammable , and is stored in mineral oil . When cut open , it exhibits a metallic luster , but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray , then black tarnish . It never occurs freely in nature , but only in ( usually ionic ) compounds , such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium . Due to its solubility as an ion , it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines . Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride .   The nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability , since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides . Because of its relative nuclear instability , lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light : it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common . For related reasons , lithium has important uses in nuclear physics . The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man - made nuclear reaction , and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons .   Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications , including heat - resistant glass and ceramics , lithium grease lubricants , flux additives for iron , steel and aluminium production , lithium batteries , and lithium - ion batteries . These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production .   Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts ; its functions are uncertain . Lithium salts have proven to be useful as a mood - stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans ."", 'Glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware . Lithium carbonate ( Li CO ) is generally used in this application because it converts to the oxide upon heating .   Electrical and electronics ( edit )   Late in the 20th century , lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes , because of its high electrode potential . Because of its low atomic mass , it has a high charge - and power - to - weight ratio . A typical lithium - ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell , compared with 2.1 volts for lead - acid or 1.5 volts for zinc - carbon cells . Lithium - ion batteries , which are rechargeable and have a high energy density , should not be confused with lithium batteries , which are disposable ( primary ) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode . Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium - ion polymer battery , lithium iron phosphate battery , and the nanowire battery .   Lubricating greases ( edit )  Main article : Lithium grease  The third most common use of lithium is in greases . Lithium hydroxide is a strong base and , when heated with a fat , produces a soap made of lithium stearate . Lithium soap has the ability to thicken oils , and it is used to manufacture all - purpose , high - temperature lubricating greases .   Metallurgy ( edit )   Lithium ( e.g. as lithium carbonate ) is used as an additive to continuous casting mould flux slags where it increases fluidity , a use which accounts for 5 % of global lithium use ( 2011 ) . Lithium compounds are also used as additives ( fluxes ) to foundry sand for iron casting to reduce veining .   Lithium ( as lithium fluoride ) is used as an additive to aluminium smelters ( Hall -- Héroult process ) , reducing melting temperature and increasing electrical resistance , a use which accounts for 3 % of production ( 2011 ) .   When used as a flux for welding or soldering , metallic lithium promotes the fusing of metals during the process and eliminates the forming of oxides by absorbing impurities . Alloys of the metal with aluminium , cadmium , copper and manganese are used to make high - performance aircraft parts ( see also Lithium - aluminium alloys ) .']","['Late in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential.

right to property according to the constitution of india is a,"[""Many constitutional amendments to Part III of the constitution were made deleting or adding or diluting the fundamental rights before the judgement of Golaknath case ( Constitutional amendments 1 , 4 , 7 and 16 ) and after the validity of 24th constitutional amendment is upheld by the Supreme Court ( Constitutional amendments 25 , 42 , 44 , 50 , 77 , 81 , 85 , 86 , 93 and 97 ) .   Validity of Article 31B ( edit )   Articles 31A and Article 31B are added by First constitutional amendment in 1951 . Article 31B says that any acts and regulations included in the Ninth Schedule of the constitution by the Parliament can override the fundamental rights and such laws can not be repealed or made void by the judiciary on the grounds of violating fundamental rights . Thus fundamental rights given in Part III are not equally applicable in each state / region and can be made different by making additions / deletions to Ninth Schedule by constitutional amendments . In 2007 , Supreme Court ruled that there could not be any blanket immunity from judicial review for the laws inserted in the Ninth Schedule . Apex court also stated it shall examine laws included in the Ninth Schedule after 1973 for any incompatibility with the basic structure doctrine .   Amendment to Article 31C ( edit )   Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment , had changed Article 31C of the constitution to accord precedence to the Directive Principles ( earlier applicable only to clauses b & c of Article 39 ) over the fundamental rights of individuals . In Minerva Mills v. Union of India case , supreme court ruled that the amendment to the Article 31C is not valid and ultra vires .   Right to property ( edit )   The Constitution originally provided for the right to property under Articles 19 and 31 . Article 19 guaranteed to all citizens the right to acquire , hold and dispose of property . Article 31 provided that `` no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law . '' It also provided that compensation would be paid to a person whose property has been taken for public purposes .   The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times ."", ""The phrases `` security of State '' , `` public order '' and `` morality '' are of wide implication . People of alternate sexuality are criminalised in India with prison term up to 10 years . The meaning of phrases like `` reasonable restrictions '' and `` the interest of public order '' have not been explicitly stated in the constitution , and this ambiguity leads to unnecessary litigation . The freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms is exercised , but in some cases , these meetings are broken up by the police through the use of non-fatal methods .   `` Freedom of press '' has not been included in the right to freedom , which is necessary for formulating public opinion and to make freedom of expression more legitimate . Employment of child labour in hazardous job environments has been reduced , but their employment even in non-hazardous jobs , including their prevalent employment as domestic help violates the spirit and ideals of the constitution . More than 16.5 million children are employed and working in India . India was ranked 88 out of 159 in 2005 , according to the degree to which corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians worldwide . But in 2014 , India has improved marginally to a rank of 85 . The right to equality in matters regarding public employment shall not be conferred to overseas citizens of India , according to the Citizenship ( Amendment ) Bill , 2003 .   As per Article 19 of Part III of the Indian constitution , the fundamental rights of people such as freedom of speech and expression , gathering peaceably without arms and forming associations or unions shall not effect the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India but not unity of India . The words sovereignty and integrity are the qualities to be cultivated / emulated by Indian people as urged by the Indian constitution but not used related to territory of India . Article 1 of Part 1 of the Indian constitution , defines India ( Bharat ) as union of states . In nutshell , India is its people not its land as enshrined in its constitution .   Since speedy trial is not the constitutional right of the citizens , the cases involving violations of fundamental rights take inordinate time for resolution by the Supreme Court which is against the legal maxim ' justice delayed is justice denied ' .   Amendments ( edit )   Changes to the fundamental rights require a constitutional amendment , which has to be passed by a special majority of both houses of Parliament .""]","['The provisions relating to the right to property were changed a number of times. The Forty-Fourth Amendment of 1978 deleted the right to property from the list of fundamental rights[36] A new provision, Article 300-A, was added to the constitution, which provided that ""no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law"". Thus if a legislature makes a law depriving a person of his property, there would be no obligation on the part of the State to pay anything as compensation. The aggrieved person shall have no right to move the court under Article 32. Thus, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right, though it is still a constitutional right.

Flex Builder included the Flex SDK , a set of components that included charting , advanced UI , and data services ( Flex Data Services ) .   In 2008 , Adobe released the tenth version of Flash , Adobe Flash CS4 . Flash 10 improved animation capabilities within the Flash editor , adding a motion editor panel ( similar to Adobe After Effects ) , inverse kinematics ( bones ) , basic 3D object animation , object - based animation , and other text and graphics features . Flash Player 10 included an in - built 3D engine ( without GPU acceleration ) that allowed basic object transformations in 3D space ( position , rotation , scaling ) .   Also in 2008 , Adobe released the first version of Adobe Integrated Runtime ( later re-branded as Adobe AIR ) , a runtime engine that replaced Flash Player , and provided additional capabilities to the ActionScript 3.0 language to build desktop and mobile applications . With AIR , developers could access the file system ( the user 's files and folders ) , and connected devices suxh as joystick , gamepad and sensors for the first time .   In 2011 , Adobe Flash Player 11 was released , and with it the first version of Stage3D , allowing GPU - accelerated 3D rendering for Flash applications and games on desktop platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X . Adobe further improved 3D capabilities from 2011 to 2013 , adding support for 3D rendering on Android and iOS platforms , alpha - channels , compressed textures , texture atlases , and other features . Adobe AIR was upgraded to support 64 - bit computers , and to allow developers to add additional functionality to the AIR runtime using AIR Native Extensions ( ANE ) .

where do they grow hops in the us,"[""Hop cones contain different oils , such as lupulin , a yellowish , waxy substance , an oleoresin , that imparts flavour and aroma to beer . Lupulin contains lupulone and humulone , which possess antibiotic properties , suppressing bacterial growth favoring brewer 's yeast to grow . After lupulin has been extracted in the brewing process the papery cones are discarded .   Migrant labor and social impact ( edit )  Hops harvest in the Kingdom of Bohemia ( 1898 ) Hops harvest in Skåne , Sweden in 1937  The need for massed labor at harvest time meant hop - growing had a big social impact . Around the world , the labor - intensive harvesting work involved large numbers of migrant workers who would travel for the annual hop harvest . Whole families would partake and live in hoppers ' huts , with even the smallest children helping in the fields . The final chapters of W. Somerset Maugham 's Of Human Bondage and a large part of George Orwell 's A Clergyman 's Daughter contain a vivid description of London families participating in this annual hops harvest . In England , many of those picking hops in Kent were from eastern areas of London . This provided a break from urban conditions that was spent in the countryside . People also came from Birmingham and other Midlands cities to pick hops in the Malvern area of Worcestershire . Some photographs have been preserved .   Particularly in Kent , because of a shortage of small - denomination coin of the realm , many growers issued their own currency to those doing the labor . In some cases , the coins issued were adorned with fanciful hops images , making them quite beautiful .   In the US , Prohibition had a major impact on hops productions , but remnants of this significant industry in West and Northwest US are still noticeable in the form of old hop kilns that survive throughout Sonoma County , among others . Florian Dauenhauer , of Santa Rosa in Sonoma County , became a manufacturer of hop - harvesting machines in 1940 , in part because of the hop industry 's importance to the county . This mechanization helped destroy the local industry by enabling large - scale mechanized production , which moved to larger farms in other areas . Dauenhauer Manufacturing remains a current producer of hop harvesting machines ."", ""Wye College have also been responsible for breeding hop varieties that will grow with only 12 hours of daily light for the South African hop farmers . Wye College was closed in 2009 but the legacy of their hop breeding programs , particularly that of the dwarf varieties , is continuing as already the U.S.A. private and public breeding programs are using their stock material .   Particular hop varieties are associated with beer regions and styles , for example pale lagers are usually brewed with European ( often German , Polish or Czech ) noble hop varieties such as Saaz , Hallertau and Strissel Spalt . British ales use hop varieties such as Fuggles , Goldings and W.G.V. North American beers often use Cascade hops , Columbus hops , Centennial hops , Willamette , Amarillo hops and about forty more varieties as the U.S.A. have lately been the more significant breeders of new hop varieties , including dwarf hop varieties .   Hops from New Zealand , such as Pacific Gem , Motueka and Nelson Sauvin , are used in a `` Pacific Pale Ale '' style of beer with increasing production in 2014 .   Noble hops ( edit )  Mature hops growing in a hop yard in Germany  The term `` noble hops '' traditionally refers to varieties of hops which are low in bitterness and high in aroma . They are the European cultivars or races Hallertau , Tettnanger , Spalt , and Saaz .   Their low relative bitterness but strong aroma are often distinguishing characteristics of European - style lagers , such as Pilsener , Dunkel , and Oktoberfest / Märzen . In beer , they are considered aroma hops ( as opposed to bittering hops ) ; see Pilsner Urquell as a classic example of the Bohemian Pilsener style , which showcases noble hops .   As with grapes , the location where hops are grown affects the hops ' characteristics . Much as Dortmunder beer may within the EU be labelled `` Dortmunder '' only if it has been brewed in Dortmund , noble hops may officially be considered `` noble '' only if they were grown in the areas for which the hop varieties ( races ) were named .

In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo-in for a beating from the bulldog. Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon: his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness. He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble, and his first speaking role was in 1944's The Bodyguard, where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949, from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler. Unlike his father Spike, Tyke does not speak. He only communicates by yapping, whimpering, growling, facial expressions and wagging his tail.

in which regions are most of africa petroleum and natural gas found,"[""In 2008 , the government prepared a Gas Master Plan that was intended to promote natural gas production and encourage the supply of natural gas to domestic power stations so as to help alleviate the country 's electricity shortages . There is also an export gas pipeline , known as the West African Gas Pipeline , in the works but has encountered numerous setbacks . The pipeline would allow for transportation of natural gas to Benin , Ghana , Togo , and Cote d'Ivoire . The majority of Nigeria 's natural gas is flared off and it is estimated that Nigeria loses 18.2 million US $ daily from the loss of the flared gas .

Subsequently , crude oil production for refineries was reduced further to as little as 75,000 barrels ( 11,900 m ) per day during the regime of Sanni Abacha . There are four major oil refineries : the Warri Refinery and Petrochemical Plant which can process 125,000 barrels ( 19,900 m ) of crude per day , the New Port Harcourt Refinery which can produce 150,000 barrels ( 24,000 m ) per day ( there is also an ' Old ' Port Harcourt Refinery with negligible production ) , as well as the now defunct Kaduna Refinery . The Port Harcourt and Warri Refineries both operate at only 30 % capacity .   It is estimated that demand and consumption of petroleum in Nigeria grows at a rate of 12.8 % annually . However , petroleum products are unavailable to most Nigerians and are quite costly , because almost all of the oil extracted by the multinational oil companies is refined overseas , while only a limited quantity is supplied to Nigerians themselves .

in which sea pearl is found in india,"[""The rarity of the black cultured pearl is now a `` comparative '' issue . The black cultured pearl is rare when compared to Chinese freshwater cultured pearls , and Japanese and Chinese akoya cultured pearls , and is more valuable than these pearls . However , it is more abundant than the South Sea pearl , which is more valuable than the black cultured pearl . This is simply because the black pearl oyster Pinctada margaritifera is far more abundant than the elusive , rare , and larger south sea pearl oyster Pinctada maxima , which can not be found in lagoons , but which must be dived for in a rare number of deep ocean habitats or grown in hatcheries .   Black pearls are very rarely black : they are usually shades of green , purple , aubergine , blue , grey , silver or peacock ( a mix of several shades , like a peacock 's feather ) .   Black cultured pearls from the black pearl oyster -- Pinctada margaritifera -- are not South Sea pearls , although they are often mistakenly described as black South Sea pearls . In the absence of an official definition for the pearl from the black oyster , these pearls are usually referred to as `` black pearls '' .   The correct definition of a South Sea pearl -- as described by CIBJO and GIA -- is a pearl produced by the Pinctada maxima pearl oyster . South Sea pearls are the color of their host Pinctada maxima oyster -- and can be white , silver , pink , gold , cream , and any combination of these basic colors , including overtones of the various colors of the rainbow displayed in the pearl nacre of the oyster shell itself .   South Sea pearls are the largest and rarest of the cultured pearls -- making them the most valuable . Prized for their exquisitely beautiful ' orient ' or lustre , South Sea pearls are now farmed in various parts of the world where the Pinctada maxima oysters can be found , with the finest South Sea pearls being produced by Paspaley along the remote coastline of North - Western Australia . White and silver colored South Sea pearls tend to come from the Broome area of Australia , while golden colored ones are more prevalent in the Philippines and Indonesia ."", ""A few species produce pearls that can be of interest as gemstones . These species include the bailer shell Melo , the giant clam Tridacna , various scallop species , Pen shells Pinna , and the Haliotis iris species of abalone . Pearls of abalone , or pāua , are mabe pearls , or blister pearls , unique to New Zealand waters and are commonly referred to as ' blue pearls ' . They are admired for their incredible luster and naturally bright vibrant colors that are often compared to opal . Another example is the conch pearl ( sometimes referred to simply as the ' pink pearl ' ) , which is found very rarely growing between the mantle and the shell of the queen conch or pink conch , Strombus gigas , a large sea snail or marine gastropod from the Caribbean Sea . These pearls , which are often pink in color , are a by - product of the conch fishing industry , and the best of them display a shimmering optical effect related to chatoyance known as ' flame structure ' .   Somewhat similar gastropod pearls , this time more orange in hue , are ( again very rarely ) found in the horse conch Pleuroploca gigantea .   The second largest pearl known was found in the Philippines in 1934 and is known as the Pearl of Lao Tzu . It is a naturally occurring , non-nacreous , calcareous concretion ( pearl ) from a giant clam . Because it did not grow in a pearl oyster it is not pearly ; instead the surface is glossy like porcelain . Other pearls from giant clams are known to exist , but this is a particularly large one weighing 14 lb ( 6.4 kg ) .   The largest known pearl ( also from a giant clam ) was found in the Philippines as well by a fisherman from Puerto Princesa , Palawan Island . The enormous pearl is 30 cm wide ( 1 ft ) , 67 cm long ( 2.2 ft ) and weighs 75 lb ( 34 kg ) .""]","[""For thousands of years, seawater pearls were retrieved by divers in the Indian Ocean in areas such as the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mannar.[29][30][31] Evidence also suggest a prehistoric origin to pearl diving in these regions.[30][31] Starting in the Han Dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), the Chinese hunted extensively for seawater pearls in the South China Sea.[citation needed] In the 14th-century Arabian Sea, the traveller Ibn Battuta provided the earliest known description of pearl diving by means of attaching a cord to the diver's waist.[citation needed]""]","The sources provided do not specifically mention which sea pearls are found in India. However, South Sea pearls, which are produced by the Pinctada maxima oyster, are farmed in various parts of the world, including regions where these oysters can be found.

Though trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker as a Jedi , he has been seduced to the dark side of the Force by Supreme Leader Snoke and aspires to be as powerful as his grandfather , Darth Vader . Kylo Ren is also the master of the Knights of Ren , as well as a commander and later the supreme leader of the First Order , an organization spawned from the fallen Galactic Empire . He is featured in The Force Awakens media and merchandising and appears in the film 's sequel , Star Wars : The Last Jedi ( 2017 ) ."", ""In January 2016 , Driver reprised the role for a Star Wars / Undercover Boss sketch on Saturday Night Live , with Kylo Ren disguising himself as a radar technician named `` Matt '' to determine what the Starkiller Base employees really think of him .

Kylo Ren is additionally mentioned in the 2017 novel Star Wars : Phasma .   Reception ( edit )  Adam Driver received positive reviews for his performance as Kylo Ren .  Both the character of Kylo Ren and Driver 's performance have been positively received . Many complimented Ren 's conflicted nature and depth , as well as his costume design , and noted there were many places the character could be taken in future installments . Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised the character and the actor alike , saying , `` He is gorgeously cruel , spiteful and capricious -- and unlike the Vader of old , he is given to petulant temper tantrums , with his lightsaber drawn . '' Terri Schwartz of IGN also called Driver 's performance `` spectacular '' , noting that `` his performance adds great depth to a character who could have come off as one - dimensional , and the implications of his arc leave a viewer with plenty to think about after they leave the theater .

how many countries are a part of opec,"[""Prices fluctuated around US $50 / bbl , and OPEC in May 2017 decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018 , with the world waiting to see if and how the oil inventory glut might be fully siphoned - off by then .

It rejoined the organization in January 2016 , but announced another `` temporary suspension '' of its membership at year - end when OPEC requested a 5 percent production cut .   Some commentators consider that the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq , due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 -- 2004 .

Sanders also had a rushing TD in the playoffs ( against the Philadelphia Eagles in January 1996 ) . This makes him ( including post season ) one of only two players in NFL history ( Bill Dudley being the other ) to score a touchdown six different ways ( interception return , punt return , kickoff return , receiving , rushing , and a fumble recovery ) .   On February 6 , 2011 , at Super Bowl XLV in Arlington , Texas , Sanders performed the pre-game coin toss .   Sanders did not attend classes or take final exams during the fall semester of his senior year at Florida State , yet played in the Sugar Bowl against Auburn . This caused the Florida State Legislature to create the ' Deion Sanders rule ' , whereby a football athlete at any state university could not play in a bowl game if he failed to successfully complete the previous semester .   In 1995 , he signed with the Dallas Cowboys for a minimum yearly base salary and a nearly $13 million signing bonus in an attempt to circumvent the NFL 's salary cap . This caused the NFL to institute its own ' Deion Sanders rule ' whereby a prorated portion of a player 's signing bonus counted against the salary cap .

The song is known for its `` la la la '' hook .     Problems playing this file ? See media help .     `` Ca n't Get You Out of My Head '' is a `` robotic '' midtempo dance - pop song , with a tempo of 126 beats per minute . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing , Minogue 's vocal range spans from C to D. Minogue chants a `` la la la '' hook in the song , which is often heralded as its most appealing part . BBC Radio 2 noted that the composition of the song is `` deceptively simple , but its veins run with the whole history of electronic music . '' They described the song 's bassline as `` pulsing , '' and recognised influences of English rock band New Order and German electronic music band Kraftwerk . The song does not follow the common verse - chorus structure and is instead composed of numerous `` misplaced sections . '' Dennis reasoned that these sections `` somehow work together '' as she and Davis `` did n't try to force any structure after the event . The seeds were watered and they very quickly sprouted into something bigger than any of us . '' Likewise , Davis commented : `` It breaks a few rules as it starts with a chorus and in comes the ' la 's ' -- that is what confused my publisher ( Fuller ) when he first heard it . ''   Through the lyrics of the song , its singer expresses an obsession with an anonymous figure . Dorian Lynskey from The Guardian termed the song a `` mystery '' as Minogue never reveals the identity of her object of infatuation . The critic suggested that the person Minogue is referring to is either `` a partner , an evasive one - night stand or someone who does n't know she exists . '' Writing for the same newspaper , Everett True identified a `` darker element '' in the simple lyrics and felt this sentiment was echoed in Minogue 's restrained vocals .""]","['""Can\'t Get You Out of My Head"" is a song recorded by Australian singer Kylie Minogue for her eighth studio album, titled Fever, which she released in 2001.

who did shakespeare write his play hamlet for,"[""In 1937 , Tyrone Guthrie directed Laurence Olivier in a Jones - inspired Hamlet at The Old Vic . Olivier later used some of these same ideas in his 1948 film version of the play .   In the 1950s , Lacan 's structuralist theories about Hamlet were first presented in a series of seminars given in Paris and later published in `` Desire and the Interpretation of Desire in Hamlet '' . Lacan postulated that the human psyche is determined by structures of language and that the linguistic structures of Hamlet shed light on human desire . His point of departure is Freud 's Oedipal theories , and the central theme of mourning that runs through Hamlet . In Lacan 's analysis , Hamlet unconsciously assumes the role of phallus -- the cause of his inaction -- and is increasingly distanced from reality `` by mourning , fantasy , narcissism and psychosis '' , which create holes ( or lack ) in the real , imaginary , and symbolic aspects of his psyche . Lacan 's theories influenced literary criticism of Hamlet because of his alternative vision of the play and his use of semantics to explore the play 's psychological landscape .   In the Bloom 's Shakespeare Through the Ages volume on Hamlet , editors Bloom and Foster express a conviction that the intentions of Shakespeare in portraying the character of Hamlet in the play exceeded the capacity of the Freudian Oedipus complex to completely encompass the extent of characteristics depicted in Hamlet throughout the tragedy : `` For once , Freud regressed in attempting to fasten the Oedipus Complex upon Hamlet : it will not stick , and merely showed that Freud did better than T.S. Eliot , who preferred Coriolanus to Hamlet , or so he said . Who can believe Eliot , when he exposes his own Hamlet Complex by declaring the play to be an aesthetic failure ? '' The book also notes James Joyce 's interpretation , stating that he `` did far better in the Library Scene of Ulysses , where Stephen marvelously credits Shakespeare , in this play , with universal fatherhood while accurately implying that Hamlet is fatherless , thus opening a pragmatic gap between Shakespeare and Hamlet . ''"", ""English poet John Milton was an early admirer of Shakespeare , and took evident inspiration from his work . As John Kerrigan discusses , Milton originally considered writing his epic poem Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) as a tragedy . While Milton did not ultimately go that route , the poem still shows distinct echoes of Shakespearean revenge tragedy , and of Hamlet in particular . As scholar Christopher N. Warren argues , Paradise Lost 's Satan `` undergoes a transformation in the poem from a Hamlet - like avenger into a Claudius - like usurper , '' a plot device that supports Milton 's larger Republican internationalist project . The poem also reworks theatrical language from Hamlet , especially around the idea of `` putting on '' certain dispositions , as when Hamlet puts on `` an antic disposition , '' similarly to the Son in Paradise Lost who `` can put on / ( God 's ) terrors . ''   Henry Fielding 's Tom Jones , published about 1749 , describes a visit to Hamlet by Tom Jones and Mr Partridge , with similarities to the `` play within a play '' . In contrast , Goethe 's Bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister 's Apprenticeship , written between 1776 and 1796 , not only has a production of Hamlet at its core but also creates parallels between the ghost and Wilhelm Meister 's dead father . In the early 1850s , in Pierre , Herman Melville focuses on a Hamlet - like character 's long development as a writer . Ten years later , Dickens 's Great Expectations contains many Hamlet - like plot elements : it is driven by revenge - motivated actions , contains ghost - like characters ( Abel Magwitch and Miss Havisham ) , and focuses on the hero 's guilt . Academic Alexander Welsh notes that Great Expectations is an `` autobiographical novel '' and `` anticipates psychoanalytic readings of Hamlet itself '' . About the same time , George Eliot 's The Mill on the Floss was published , introducing Maggie Tulliver `` who is explicitly compared with Hamlet '' though `` with a reputation for sanity '' .   L. Frank Baum 's first published short story was `` They Played a New Hamlet '' ( 1895 ) .""]","[""The story of Shakespeare's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth, preserved by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by the 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest.

where does the story the great gatsby take place,"[""Like Gatsby , Fitzgerald was driven by his love for a woman who symbolized everything he wanted , even as she led him toward everything he despised .   In her book Careless People : Murder , Mayhem and the Invention of ' The Great Gatsby ( 2013 ) , Sarah Churchwell speculates that parts of the ending of The Great Gatsby were based on the Hall - Mills Case . Based on her forensic search for clues , she asserts that the two victims in the Hall - Mills murder case inspired the characters who were murdered in The Great Gatsby .   Plot summary ( edit )   The main events of the novel take place in the summer of 1922 . Nick Carraway , a Yale graduate and veteran of the Great War from the Midwest -- who serves as the novel 's narrator -- takes a job in New York as a bond salesman . He rents a small house on Long Island , in the fictional village of West Egg , next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby , a mysterious multi-millionaire who holds extravagant parties but does not participate in them . Nick drives around the bay to East Egg for dinner at the home of his cousin , Daisy Fay Buchanan , and her husband , Tom , a college acquaintance of Nick 's . They introduce Nick to Jordan Baker , an attractive , cynical young golfer with whom Nick begins a romantic relationship . She reveals to Nick that Tom has a mistress , Myrtle Wilson , who lives in the `` valley of ashes '' , an industrial dumping ground between West Egg and New York City . Not long after this revelation , Nick travels to New York City with Tom and Myrtle to an apartment Tom keeps for his affairs with Myrtle and others . At Tom 's New York apartment , a vulgar and bizarre party takes place . It ends with Tom breaking Myrtle 's nose after she annoys him by saying Daisy 's name several times .  The Plaza Hotel in the early - 1920s  As the summer progresses , Nick eventually receives an invitation to one of Gatsby 's parties . Nick encounters Jordan Baker at the party , and they meet Gatsby himself , an aloof and surprisingly young man who recognizes Nick from their same division in the Great War ."", ""The play failed miserably , and Fitzgerald worked that winter on magazine stories struggling to pay his debt caused by the production . The stories were , in his words , `` all trash and it nearly broke my heart , '' although included among those stories was `` Winter Dreams '' , which Fitzgerald later described as `` a sort of first draft of the Gatsby idea '' .   After the birth of their child , the Fitzgeralds moved to Great Neck , New York , on Long Island , in October 1922 . The town was used as the scene of The Great Gatsby . Fitzgerald 's neighbors in Great Neck included such prominent and newly wealthy New Yorkers as writer Ring Lardner , actor Lew Fields , and comedian Ed Wynn . These figures were all considered to be `` new money '' , unlike those who came from Manhasset Neck or Cow Neck Peninsula , places which were home to many of New York 's wealthiest established families , and which sat across the bay from Great Neck . This real - life juxtaposition gave Fitzgerald his idea for `` West Egg '' and `` East Egg '' . In this novel , Great Neck ( King 's Point ) became the `` new money '' peninsula of West Egg and Port Washington ( Sands Point ) the old - money East Egg . Several mansions in the area served as inspiration for Gatsby 's home , such as Oheka Castle and Beacon Towers , since demolished .   By mid-1923 , Fitzgerald had written 18,000 words for his novel but discarded most of his new story as a false start , some of which resurfaced in the 1924 short story `` Absolution '' .   Work on The Great Gatsby began in earnest in April 1924 . Fitzgerald wrote in his ledger , `` Out of woods at last and starting novel . '' He decided to make a departure from the writing process of his previous novels and told Perkins that the novel was to be a `` consciously artistic achievement '' and a `` purely creative work -- not trashy imaginings as in my stories but the sustained imagination of a sincere and yet radiant world . '' He added later , during editing , that he felt `` an enormous power in me now , more than I 've ever had . '' Soon after this burst of inspiration , work slowed while the Fitzgeralds made a move to the French Riviera , where a serious crisis in their relationship soon developed .""]","[""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows a cast of characters living in the fictional town of West Egg on prosperous Long Island in the summer of 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that has been described as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.[1][2]"", ""Set on the prosperous Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby provides a critical social history of America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional narrative. That era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses many of these societal developments of the 1920s that were to build Gatsby's stories from many of the simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which was the source of Gatsby's fortune.[5] Fitzgerald depicts the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing the book's plotline within the historical context of the era.[6]"", ""The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel written by American author F.
