1. **Green Procurement**: Encourage customers to choose providers that share their values regarding sustainability. This includes buying green services/products, using green providers, and developers working for green companies. Green procurement makes environmental sustainability essential for economic sustainability.

2. **Sustainability via Compliance**: Align with regulatory goals, such as the EU's aim to be carbon neutral by 2030. This includes initiatives like extending the smartphone lifetime, supporting the right-to-repair movement, and making IT services relying on clean energy more accessible.

3. **Green Software Development**: Focus on building energy-efficient software, especially for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices. This involves energy-efficiency testing and improvement, which contributes to environmental sustainability.

4. **Awareness and Education**: Educate software consumers and developers about the climate impact of their behavior and the importance of environmentally sustainable practices. This can also involve training green IT experts to meet sustainability goals.

5. **Avoiding Greenwashing**: Ensure that sustainability claims are genuine and not just marketing tactics. This involves transparency and accountability in sustainability efforts.

By implementing these strategies, the software engineering industry can contribute to a more sustainable future.","Driving sustainability in the software engineering industry involves implementing practices that reduce environmental impact, promote resource efficiency, and encourage ethical development processes.",0.99999999995,1.0,1.0,0.17,0.0,0.9710724105132303

1. **Economical**: Focuses on assets, capital, and added value, ensuring that software projects are economically sustainable by creating wealth, profitability, and meeting contractual requirements. Economical sustainability is crucial as a project will not survive without it.

2. **Technical**: Involves the longevity and evolution of information, systems, and infrastructure. It includes managing technical debt, scalability, software testing, and innovation. Technical sustainability ensures that software can adapt to changing conditions and remain functional over time.

3. **Individual**: Concerns the well-being of individuals within an organization, including mental and physical health, self-respect, education, and career development. Ensuring individual sustainability helps maintain a productive and motivated workforce.

4. **Social**: Relates to societal communities and factors that erode trust, such as social equity, justice, employment, and democracy. It also includes compliance with policies and regulations, ensuring that software development practices do not harm societal structures.

5. **Environmental**: Focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of software throughout its lifecycle, including development, usage, and disposal. It aligns closely with green software practices, emphasizing energy efficiency and reducing e-waste.

Each dimension contributes to sustainable software development by addressing different aspects of sustainability, ensuring that software systems are economically viable, technically robust, socially responsible, individually supportive, and environmentally friendly.","Software engineering encompasses several dimensions, including Technical, Economical, Social, Individual, Environmental, and Sustainable aspects.

1. **Energy Patterns for Mobile Apps**: Implement design patterns that improve energy efficiency, such as providing dark UI colors for AMOLED screens, using dynamic retry delays to reduce unnecessary power consumption, and batching operations to minimize extraneous energy use.

2. **Carbon-aware Datacenters**: Develop datacenters that are aware of their carbon footprint and optimize energy usage based on carbon intensity.

3. **Energy Regression Testing**: Incorporate energy consumption as a metric in regression testing to identify and mitigate energy inefficiencies in software.

4. **Debugging Energy with Docker Images**: Use Docker images to profile and debug energy consumption, particularly for machine learning workloads.

5. **Energy Efficiency vs Code Quality**: Balance energy efficiency with code quality by identifying and addressing energy anti-patterns in code.

6. **Sustainable Software Engineering Projects**: Engage in projects that focus on sustainability, such as creating benchmarks for cross-machine energy comparisons, adding energy metrics to software tools, and developing visualizations for energy data.

7. **Education and Awareness**: Educate software engineers about sustainable practices and the importance of energy efficiency in software development.

It is called a paradox because, counterintuitively, efforts to reduce energy consumption through efficiency can lead to an overall increase in energy use.","The Rebound effect, also known as Jevons Paradox in economics and Downs‚ÄìThomson paradox in mobility, occurs when energy consumption decreases but demand increases.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

1. **Environmental Impact**: Designing data centers, setting up operations, and developing AI for IoT devices all have significant environmental footprints. By focusing on sustainability, professionals can reduce energy consumption and minimize the carbon footprint of these technologies.

2. **Economic Sustainability**: Sustainable practices can lead to cost savings through energy efficiency and reduced resource consumption. This is important for roles like a CEO or CTO, where financial performance is a key concern.

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: As governments push for carbon neutrality and stricter environmental regulations, professionals in these fields must ensure compliance to avoid penalties and maintain market access.

4. **Competitive Advantage**: Sustainability is becoming a competitive factor. Companies that prioritize eco-friendly practices can attract environmentally conscious consumers and partners, which is crucial for roles like a green software developer or sustainability consultant.

5. **Innovation and Leadership**: Embracing sustainability can drive innovation, leading to new products and services that meet the growing demand for green solutions. This is particularly relevant for green advocates and those starting green tech startups.

6. **Social Responsibility**: Professionals have a role in addressing climate change and its disproportionate impact on poorer countries. By integrating sustainability into their work, they contribute to global efforts to mitigate these effects.

Overall, sustainability is integral to ensuring long-term viability, compliance, and ethical responsibility across various career paths.","Sustainability is important in various career paths because it influences roles such as designing or maintaining data centers, setting up operations or devops, developing AI for IoT devices, and leadership roles like CEO or CTO.
