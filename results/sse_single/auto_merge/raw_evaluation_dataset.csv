This can include adapting software to be more energy-efficient, which helps reduce the carbon footprint of applications and systems. 

For instance, the concept of ""Informed Adaptation"" mentioned in the sources involves regularly checking for changes in data and updating AI models accordingly. This ensures that software remains efficient and effective in its operations, potentially reducing unnecessary energy consumption. By only updating models when necessary, it minimizes computational resources, thereby conserving energy and reducing emissions.

Moreover, adaptation can also mean incorporating energy patterns for mobile apps, using carbon-aware datacenters, and employing energy regression testing to ensure that software changes do not negatively impact energy efficiency. These practices collectively contribute to addressing climate change by making software more sustainable and reducing its environmental impact.","The term 'adaption' is mentioned in the context of climate change, alongside other buzzwords such as eco-friendly, energy efficiency, and environmental responsibility."

2. **Technical**: Involves the longevity and evolution of information, systems, and infrastructure. It addresses technical debt, scalability, software testing, and innovation to ensure that software systems can adapt to changing conditions.

3. **Individual**: Concerns the well-being of individuals within an organization, including mental and physical health, self-respect, education, and career development. It emphasizes how individuals interact and collaborate.

4. **Social**: Deals with societal communities and factors that erode trust, such as social equity, justice, employment, and democracy. It also includes compliance with policies and regulations.

5. **Environmental**: Focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of software throughout its lifecycle, including development, usage, and disposal. It is closely related to green software, which emphasizes energy efficiency and reducing e-waste.

Each dimension contributes to sustainable software development by ensuring that software systems are not only economically viable but also socially responsible, technically robust, individually supportive, and environmentally friendly.","Software engineering encompasses several dimensions, including Technical, Economical, Social, Individual, Environmental, and Sustainable aspects.

- **Carbon-neutral** means that any carbon emissions produced are offset by equivalent carbon savings elsewhere, such as through carbon credits or other offsetting measures.

- Carbon accounting and management
- Energy efficiency technologies

Ensuring a higher Bus factor contributes to the sustainability of software by promoting knowledge sharing and reducing dependency on specific team members, thereby enhancing the resilience and continuity of the project.",Bus-factor is a relevant consideration in software sustainability.
