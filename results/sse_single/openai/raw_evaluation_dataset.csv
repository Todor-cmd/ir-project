Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

This is a key aspect of sustainable software engineering, which aims to create long-term value while minimizing environmental impact. Adaptation can involve various strategies, such as:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Developing software that is energy-efficient, which reduces the carbon footprint and conserves resources. This includes optimizing code, reducing computational demands, and using energy-efficient algorithms.

2. **Carbon-Aware Computing**: Implementing systems like Google's Carbon-Intelligent Computing System (CICS), which shifts datacenter jobs in time based on carbon intensity data to reduce emissions during peak carbon-intensive hours.

3. **Green AI**: Adopting practices that reduce the energy consumption of AI models, such as using pre-trained models, optimizing hyperparameters, and selecting green datacenters.

4. **Green Procurement**: Choosing software and service providers that prioritize sustainability, which encourages the industry to adopt greener practices.

5. **Compliance and Regulations**: Adapting to policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, such as the EU's goal to be carbon neutral by 2030, which affects the ICT sector.

By integrating these adaptive strategies, software developers can contribute to mitigating climate change while ensuring their systems remain efficient and sustainable.","The term 'adaption' is mentioned in the context of climate change, alongside other buzzwords such as eco-friendly, energy efficiency, and environmental responsibility."

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

1. **Green Procurement**: Encourage customers and organizations to choose providers and partners that share their sustainability values. This includes buying green services/products, using green providers, and developers working for green companies. Green procurement makes environmental sustainability essential for economic sustainability.

2. **Compliance with Regulations**: Adhering to policies and regulations aimed at reducing carbon footprints, such as the EU's goal to be carbon neutral by 2030. This includes initiatives like extending smartphone lifetimes and supporting the right-to-repair movement.

3. **Green Software Development**: Focus on building energy-efficient software, especially for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices. This involves energy-efficiency testing and improvements.

4. **Green AI**: Adopt practices that reduce the energy consumption of AI systems, such as using green datacenters, running on low carbon intensity hours, and optimizing hardware and software for energy efficiency.

5. **Education and Awareness**: Educate software engineers and organizations about sustainable practices and the importance of reducing the environmental impact of software development.

6. **Innovation and Tools**: Develop tools and frameworks that help measure and reduce the energy consumption of software applications. This includes energy profiling tools and methodologies for debugging software energy consumption.

7. **Community Engagement**: Involve communities and organizations in sustainability initiatives, such as ClimateAction.tech and Green TU, to foster collaboration and innovation in sustainable practices.

By integrating these strategies, the software engineering industry can significantly reduce its environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future.","Driving sustainability in the software engineering industry involves implementing practices that reduce environmental impact, promote resource efficiency, and encourage ethical development processes."

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Why?\r\n\r\nOne would expect zero carbon intensity from solar-\r\npanels or wind farms, but that‚Äôs not the case.\r\n‚ö†\r\n?\r\n\r\nMarginal Power Plant\r\n‚Ä¢ Renewable-based power plants cannot adapt to demand. \r\n‚Ä¢ When demand is higher than the existing power in the electricity grid, we \r\nneed a power plant that is able to scale up to that demand. \r\n‚Ä¢ This is usually done by fossil-based power plants. They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', 'It‚Äôs more important that we learn how to \r\ndiscuss this topic and come up with new ideas than learning all the theory. \r\nCritical thinking over checkboxes. \r\n‚Ä¢ Mix of content and discussion \r\n‚Ä¢ Ultimately, the lectures aim to give you food for thought and the necessary \r\nknowledge to excel in Project 2.

Marketing teams are already leveraging eco-friendly labels to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers, although technical teams are still catching up. This shift in consumer behavior is prompting organizations to prioritize sustainability, as it can influence customer decisions and brand perception. Additionally, green procurement practices, where customers choose providers that align with their sustainability values, are making environmental sustainability essential for economic sustainability in the software industry.","Environmental sustainability has become a key competitive factor in software projects as consumers increasingly prioritize the climate impact of their digital behavior.

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', 'Carolin Brandt \r\nC.E.Brandt@tudelft.nl \r\nLu√≠s Cruz \r\nL.Cruz@tudelft.nl \r\n1.

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

2. **Technical**: Involves the longevity and evolution of information systems and infrastructure, addressing issues like technical debt, scalability, software testing, and innovation to ensure that software can adapt to changing conditions.

3. **Individual**: Concerns the well-being of individuals within an organization, including mental and physical health, self-respect, education, and career development, which are crucial for maintaining a productive and motivated workforce.

4. **Social**: Relates to societal communities and factors that erode trust, such as social equity, justice, employment, and democracy, ensuring compliance with policies and regulations to maintain societal trust.

5. **Environmental**: Focuses on minimizing the impact of software on the planet throughout its lifecycle, including energy efficiency and reducing e-waste, aligning closely with the principles of Green Software.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', ""‚Ä¢ 6 machine learning algorithms: SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forrest, \r\nAdaBoost, Bagging Classifier. \r\n‚Ä¢ Reduce the number of rows. 10%, 20%, .., 100% \r\n‚Ä¢ Stratified random sampling (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Reduce the number of features. 10%, 20%, .., 100% \r\n‚Ä¢ Feature importance metric based on the Chi-Square Test (Chi2) \r\n‚Ä¢ Estimate energy consumption using a RAPL-based tool.

Aka 100-global-warming \r\npotential (100-GWP). \r\n \r\n \r\n‚Ä¢ Co2-eq is expressed in mass ‚Äì e.g., \r\nCO2eq =\r\n‚àë\r\ng‚ààGHG\r\n(GWPg ‚ãÖmg)\r\nkgCO2eq\r\n22\r\n\r\nCarbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2-eq)\r\n \r\n \r\n‚Ä¢ As an example, imagine that to run our software system \r\nour electricity provider emits 1000Kg of CO2, 20Kg of \r\nCH4, 5Kg of N2O, 0Kg of the remaining GHG.\r\nCO2eq =\r\n‚àë\r\ng‚ààGHG\r\n(GWPg ‚ãÖmg)\r\n23\r\nCO2eq = GWPCO2 ‚ãÖmCO2 + GWPCH4 ‚ãÖmCH4 + GWPN2O ‚ãÖmN2O\r\n= 1 √ó 1000 + 21 √ó 20 + 310 √ó 5\r\n= 2670kgCO2eq\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- 100-GWP is only an estimation;  \r\n- different sources reveal different estimations; \r\n- there is also the 20-GWP and the 500-GWP. \r\nI use this source: Foster et al.

[‚Ä¶] \r\n‚Ä¢ Solution: Study the importance of graphics and \r\nanimations to the user experience and reduce them when \r\napplicable. [‚Ä¶]\r\n‚Ä¢ Example: Resort to low frame rates for animations when \r\npossible. \r\nDespite being important to improve user experience, graphics \r\nand animations are battery intensive and should be used with \r\nmoderation.  \r\n14\r\n\r\nEnergy Patterns are \r\nmore Frequent\r\nin Android Apps\r\n\r\nExample case: Nextcloud\r\nFOSS\r\n\r\nExample case: Nextcloud\r\n‚Ä¢ Users complain that sometimes they go on a trip and  Nextcloud drains their \r\nbattery. Users consider uninstalling the app when battery life is essential. \r\n‚Ä¢ File sync can be energy-greedy. Send large files to the server, long 3G/4G data connections. \r\n‚Ä¢ It is mostly used for backup.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', 'Lu√≠s Cruz \r\nL.Cruz@tudelft.nl \r\n10.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', 'p-value = 0.04\r\nOn average, version B spent less energy than version A  ‚Äî  ‚úÖ \r\nThere is statistical significance ‚Äî  ‚úÖ \r\nEffect size, percent-change is ‚âà1% ‚Äî ü§î \r\n‚ö† Do we care?\r\n(?)\r\n\r\nPractical Significance\r\n‚Ä¢ Depending on the case, a 2% improvement might be either wonderful or completely \r\nuseless. \r\n‚Ä¢ Effect size analyses help assess practical significance but might not be enough. \r\n‚Ä¢ A critical discussion always needs to be performed.

1. **Asset Management**: Efficiently manage and utilize assets to maximize their value and contribution to the company's operations. This includes regular maintenance, upgrades, and strategic allocation of resources.

2. **Capital Investment**: Make informed decisions about where to invest capital to generate the highest returns. This involves evaluating potential projects, understanding market trends, and assessing risks.

3. **Profitability Analysis**: Continuously analyze the profitability of different business segments and products to identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated to the most profitable ventures.

4. **Cost Management**: Implement effective cost control measures to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve the overall efficiency of operations.

5. **Funding and Financing**: Secure appropriate funding and financing options to support growth initiatives while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. This includes managing debt levels and exploring equity financing if necessary.

6. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate financial risks that could impact the company's assets and capital. This includes market risks, credit risks, and operational risks.

7. **Compliance and Regulations**: Ensure compliance with financial regulations and standards to avoid legal issues and potential fines that could affect profitability.

8. **Sustainability**: Consider the long-term sustainability of investments and operations, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, which can impact the company's reputation and financial performance.

By focusing on these areas, a company can effectively manage its assets and capital to create value and achieve profitability.","When managing assets and capital, a company should consider wealth creation, prosperity, profitability, capital investment, income, the number of customers, man-day-rate estimates, the next round of funding, and meeting requirements in contracts."

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

1. **Green Procurement**: Organizations can choose providers that share their values on sustainability. This includes customers buying green services/products, companies using green providers, and developers working for green companies. Green procurement makes environmental sustainability essential for economic sustainability.

2. **Sustainability via Compliance**: Adhering to regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing carbon footprints, such as the EU's goal to be carbon neutral by 2030, can drive sustainability. This includes extending the lifespan of devices and supporting the right-to-repair movement.

3. **Energy Efficiency and Green Software**: Building energy-efficient software is crucial. This involves developing software that runs efficiently on limited power resources, such as smartphones and IoT devices, and conducting energy-efficiency testing and improvements.

4. **Carbon-aware Datacenters**: Utilizing datacenters that operate on low carbon intensity hours and selecting green datacenters can reduce the carbon footprint of software operations.

5. **Green AI Practices**: Implementing practices such as using pre-trained models, optimizing hyperparameter tuning, and adopting data-centric AI approaches can reduce the energy consumption of AI systems.

6. **Education and Awareness**: Educating software engineers and stakeholders about sustainable practices and the importance of reducing the environmental impact of software development can foster a culture of sustainability.

7. **Reporting and Benchmarking**: Establishing benchmarks for energy and carbon metrics and reporting these metrics can help in assessing and improving the sustainability of software systems.

By integrating these approaches, the software engineering industry can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability.","Driving sustainability in the software engineering industry involves implementing practices that reduce the environmental impact of software development and operation, promote resource efficiency, and consider the entire lifecycle of software systems."

Their goal is to be carbon-free by 2030. 

The difference between carbon-free and carbon-neutral is that being carbon-free means not emitting any carbon emissions at all, while being carbon-neutral means balancing emitted carbon with an equivalent amount of carbon offsets, effectively bringing net emissions to zero.

To achieve these goals, Green IT experts are needed. These experts focus on developing and implementing technologies and practices that reduce carbon emissions and improve energy efficiency in IT operations.","Google, Microsoft, and Meta/Facebook are called carbon-free giants.

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', ""Unless there‚Äôs a \r\ngood reason. \r\n‚Ä¢ E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n‚Ä¢ (It happens and that‚Äôs ok!)‚Äì consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy ‚Äì falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n‚Ä¢ If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Energy consumption data analysis \r\n\r\nEnergy tests are flaky\r\n‚Ä¢ Multiple runs might yield different results \r\n‚Ä¢ There are many confounding factors that need to be controlled/minimized.\r\n3\r\n?\r\n\r\nZen mode üßò\r\n‚Ä¢ Close all applications. \r\n‚Ä¢ Turn off notifications. \r\n‚Ä¢ Only the required hardware should be connected (avoid USB drives, external \r\ndisks, external displays, etc.). \r\n‚Ä¢ Kill unnecessary services running in the background (e.g., web server, file \r\nsharing, etc.). \r\n‚Ä¢ If you do not need an internet or intranet connection, switch off your network. \r\n‚Ä¢ Prefer cable over wireless ‚Äì the energy consumption from a cable connection \r\nis more stable than from a wireless connection.\r\n4\r\n\r\nFreeze and report your settings ü•∂\r\n‚Ä¢ Fix display brightness; switch off auto brightness \r\n‚Ä¢ If Wifi is on, it should always be on, connected to the same network/\r\nendpoint.‚Ä¶\r\n5\r\n\r\nWarm-up üì∂\r\n‚Ä¢ Energy consumption is highly affected by the temperature of your hardware. \r\n‚Ä¢ Higher the temperature -> higher the resistance of electrical conductors ->\u2028\r\n-> higher dissipation -> higher energy consumption \r\n‚Ä¢ The first execution will appear more efficient because the hardware is still \r\ncold. \r\n‚Ä¢ Run a CPU-intensive task before measuring energy consumption. E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n‚Ä¢\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat üîÅ\r\n‚Ä¢ The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n‚Ä¢ In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ‚è∏\r\n‚Ä¢ It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n‚Ä¢ Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n‚Ä¢ Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle üîÄ\r\n‚Ä¢ It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n‚Ä¢ If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n‚Ä¢ External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n‚Ä¢ If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool üå°\r\n‚Ä¢ Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n‚Ä¢ Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n‚Ä¢ If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions ü§ñ\r\n‚Ä¢ (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n‚Ä¢ One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation‚Ä¶\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n‚Ä¢ Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n‚Ä¢ Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

It focuses on several dimensions, including economical, social, technical, individual, and environmental aspects.

In terms of environmental sustainability, it involves developing software that has minimal impact on the planet throughout its lifecycle. This includes considering energy efficiency, reducing e-waste, and ensuring that software systems are designed to be environmentally responsible. Sustainable Software Engineering also aligns with concepts like Green Software, which emphasizes building energy-efficient software, especially for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices.

By focusing on these aspects, Sustainable Software Engineering contributes to creating long-term value by ensuring that software systems are not only economically viable but also socially and environmentally responsible. This approach helps in reducing the carbon footprint of software systems, promoting energy efficiency, and supporting the broader goals of sustainability in technology.",Sustainable Software Engineering is the discipline that studies the process of creating software systems that are able to create value in the long term without hindering its surrounding environment.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n‚Ä¢ The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n‚Ä¢ External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n‚Ä¢ We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n‚Ä¢ Use the z-score outlier removal.

Typically, job schedulers use a metric of cluster capacity to schedule a job in \r\na particular cluster. \r\n‚Ä¢ CICS overrides this metric with the virtual capacity curve (VCC) that \r\nfactors in Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ When a new job comes in, the scheduler estimates its CPU load and power \r\nusage and assigns it to a cluster if the VCC is not exceeded.\r\n23\r\n\r\n‚Ä¢ Jobs are divided between flexible and inflexible. \r\n‚Ä¢ Flexible load is considered shapeable/shiftable as long as its total daily \r\ncompute (CPU) demand is preserved \r\n‚Ä¢ The system needs to consider that, while running a job, the virtual capacity \r\ncurve (VCC) might drop. Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

As a result, the total energy consumption may not decrease as much as expected, or it might even increase. This effect occurs because the cost savings from improved efficiency can lead to increased usage, either because the service becomes cheaper or because it enables new uses.

It is called a paradox because, intuitively, one would expect that making a process more energy-efficient would lead to a straightforward reduction in total energy consumption. However, the opposite can occur due to increased demand, which contradicts the initial expectation.","The Rebound effect, also known as Jevons Paradox in economics and Downs‚ÄìThomson paradox in mobility, occurs when energy consumption decreases but demand increases.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', '27\r\n\r\nCarbon intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ How much carbon is emitted per kWh of electricity consumed. \r\n‚Ä¢ The common unit: \r\n ü§∑ \r\n‚Ä¢ E.g.,  gas-based power plants emit less carbon than coal-based plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The power grid is a mix between different sources of electricity ‚Äì different \r\nlocations have different carbon intensity.\r\ngCO2eq/kWh\r\n28\r\n\r\nhttps://app.electricitymaps.com/map\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nüìù Reducing software energy consumption can help reduce the carbon intensity.

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.\r\n\r\nRecap\r\n‚Ä¢ Power \r\n‚Ä¢ Energy \r\n‚Ä¢ Average Power \r\n‚Ä¢ Energy Delay Product \r\n‚Ä¢ Electric charge (battery capacity) \r\n‚Ä¢ Carbon dioxide equivalent (carbon emissions) \r\n‚Ä¢ 100-global-warming potential \r\n‚Ä¢ Carbon Intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Marginal Carbon Intensity\r\n37\r\n?\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n‚Ä¢ Blog post on energy units:\u2028\r\nhttps://luiscruz.github.io/2023/05/13/energy-units.html \r\n38\r\n?', '8\r\n\r\nhttps://tqrg.github.io/energy-patterns\r\n\r\nDark UI Colors \r\nProvide a dark UI color theme to \r\nsave battery on devices with \r\nAMOLED screens.\r\n‚Ä¢ Context: [‚Ä¶] Apps that require heavy usage of screen can \r\nhave a substantial negative impact on battery life. \r\n‚Ä¢ Solution: Provide a UI theme with dark background colors.

If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n‚Ä¢ Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n‚Ä¢ The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n‚Ä¢ External physical conditions have changed.

This includes considering the environmental effects at various stages such as development, usage, and servicing, as well as addressing issues like e-waste. Green Software is closely related and focuses on sustainability and energy efficiency. It emphasizes building energy-efficient software, which is crucial for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices. By improving energy efficiency, Green Software contributes to Environmental Sustainability by reducing the environmental footprint, such as fewer battery cycles and less energy consumption, which in turn supports user experience by reducing the need for frequent recharging. Essentially, Green Software is a component of Environmental Sustainability, aiming to minimize the ecological impact of software systems.","Environmental Sustainability in software engineering is focused on creating software with minimal environmental impact throughout its lifecycle, which is almost identical to the concept of Green Software."

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if

Why?\r\n\r\nOne would expect zero carbon intensity from solar-\r\npanels or wind farms, but that‚Äôs not the case.\r\n‚ö†\r\n?\r\n\r\nMarginal Power Plant\r\n‚Ä¢ Renewable-based power plants cannot adapt to demand. \r\n‚Ä¢ When demand is higher than the existing power in the electricity grid, we \r\nneed a power plant that is able to scale up to that demand. \r\n‚Ä¢ This is usually done by fossil-based power plants.

1. **Alignment with Personal Values**: Many developers are motivated by personal values and a desire to contribute positively to the environment. Working for a green company allows them to align their professional work with their personal beliefs about sustainability and environmental responsibility.

2. **Career Opportunities**: As sustainability becomes a more significant factor in business, green companies often offer innovative projects and cutting-edge technologies that can be attractive to developers looking to advance their careers.

3. **Market Demand**: There is a growing demand for sustainable products and services. Developers working for green companies can be part of creating solutions that meet this demand, which can be both professionally rewarding and financially beneficial.

4. **Corporate Culture**: Green companies often foster a corporate culture that emphasizes social responsibility, ethical practices, and a supportive work environment, which can be appealing to developers.

5. **Economic Sustainability**: Green procurement is becoming essential for economic sustainability, as customers increasingly prefer services and products from environmentally responsible companies. This trend can lead to job security and growth opportunities within green companies.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: With increasing regulations aimed at reducing carbon footprints, developers working for green companies may find themselves at the forefront of compliance and innovation, which can be intellectually stimulating and rewarding.

These factors make green companies attractive to developers who are not only interested in technology but also in making a positive impact on the world.",Developers work for green companies because green procurement is a main trigger for organizations to worry about sustainability and green software.

[‚Ä¶]\r\n‚Ä¢ Example: Consider a mobile app that provides a news feed and \r\nthe app is not able to reach the server to collect updates. [‚Ä¶] use \r\nthe Fibonacci series to increase the time between attempts.\r\nWhenever an attempt to access a \r\nresource fails, increase the time \r\ninterval before retrying.\r\n12\r\n\r\nBatch Operations \r\n‚Ä¢ Context: Executing operations separately leads to extraneous \r\ntail energy consumptions  \r\n‚Ä¢ Solution: Bundle multiple operations in a single one.

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.\r\n\r\nRecap\r\n‚Ä¢ Power \r\n‚Ä¢ Energy \r\n‚Ä¢ Average Power \r\n‚Ä¢ Energy Delay Product \r\n‚Ä¢ Electric charge (battery capacity) \r\n‚Ä¢ Carbon dioxide equivalent (carbon emissions) \r\n‚Ä¢ 100-global-warming potential \r\n‚Ä¢ Carbon Intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Marginal Carbon Intensity\r\n37\r\n?\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n‚Ä¢ Blog post on energy units:\u2028\r\nhttps://luiscruz.github.io/2023/05/13/energy-units.html \r\n38\r\n?', '‚Ä¢ In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ‚è∏\r\n‚Ä¢ It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n‚Ä¢ Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n‚Ä¢ Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n‚Ä¢ The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n‚Ä¢ Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: ‚ÄúLiterature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal ‚Äú\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n‚Ä¢ Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', ""‚Ä¢ Our question: Can we save energy with alternative approaches? \r\n‚Ä¢ We studied Grid Search, Random Search and Bayesian \r\nOptimisation.\r\n27\r\nTim's MSc Thesis, 2022 \r\nAccepted at CAIN‚Äô23\r\n\r\n\r\nResults\r\n29\r\nConclusions? \r\n‚Ä¢ Bayesian converges faster. \r\n‚Ä¢ No clear winner between Grid and Random\r\n\r\nDeepSeekMoE\r\n30\r\nPreprint at ArXiv, 2024 https://arxiv.org/pdf/\r\n2401.06066\r\n\r\nMixture of Experts\r\n‚Ä¢ Llama3.1 has 405B parameters, DeepSeek V3 671B \r\n‚Ä¢ Yet DeepSeek has quicker inference times and claims less energy \r\nconsumption (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Divide the model into smaller blocks of experts \r\n‚Ä¢ Tokens get routed to certain experts based on the query \r\n‚Ä¢ Only part of the network is active during inference \r\n‚Ä¢ DeepSeek claims only 37B out of 671B parameters get active\r\n31\r\n\r\nDeepSeekMoE\r\n32\r\n\r\nDeepSeekMoE\r\n33\r\n‚Ä¢ Comparable performance to \r\nLLaMA2 7B effectively using \r\nless half the parameters \r\n‚Ä¢ Less computational power \r\n‚Ä¢ Problems (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Still need to load all the \r\nparameters \r\n‚Ä¢ High memory -> high \r\nembodied carbon\r\n\r\nGreen AI at FacebookMeta\r\n34\r\nSustainable AI: Environmental Implications, \r\nChallenges and Opportunities (2022)\r\n\r\nCarbon footprint mapped to the AI lifecycle\r\n‚Ä¢ There are 4 main overarching stages where carbon emissions need to be isolated: data \r\ncollection, experimentation, training, inference. \r\n‚Ä¢ At Facebook, recommendation systems split energy consumption evenly between \r\ntraining and inference; text translation models have a 35%/65% split.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n‚Ä¢ Considers Carbon intensity \r\n‚Ä¢ Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n‚Ä¢ It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n‚Ä¢ This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n‚Ä¢ Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities‚Äô \r\ntemperature). \r\n‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n‚Ä¢ They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', '‚Ä¢ By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n‚Ä¢ If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n‚Ä¢ This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù low. \r\n‚Ä¢ The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n‚Ä¢ They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n‚Ä¢ I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n‚Ä¢ It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n‚Ä¢ Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n‚Ä¢ How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n‚ÜíEnergy?\r\nGreener?

Exploratory Analysis\r\n‚Ä¢ Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n‚Ä¢ Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n‚Ä¢ Data should be Normal. Unless there‚Äôs a \r\ngood reason. \r\n‚Ä¢ E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n‚Ä¢ (It happens and that‚Äôs ok!)‚Äì consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy ‚Äì falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n‚Ä¢ If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n‚Ä¢ It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n‚Ä¢ There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n‚Ä¢ Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n‚Ä¢ The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n‚Ä¢ External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n‚Ä¢ We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n‚Ä¢ Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.

(?) \r\n‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n‚Ä¢ Data should be Normal. Unless there‚Äôs a \r\ngood reason. \r\n‚Ä¢ E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n‚Ä¢ (It happens and that‚Äôs ok!)‚Äì consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy ‚Äì falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n‚Ä¢ If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n‚Ä¢ It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n‚Ä¢ There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n‚Ä¢ Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n‚Ä¢ There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n‚Ä¢ The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n‚Ä¢ External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n‚Ä¢ We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n‚Ä¢ Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n‚Ä¢ Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.
