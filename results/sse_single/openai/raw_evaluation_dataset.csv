Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Energy Efficiency vs Code Quality \r\n\r\n• While learning about these works, try to be critical about them and find their \r\npitfalls.\r\n3\r\n\r\n• We have seen that measuring energy consumption is not trivial \r\n• It is not practical considering that developers have other priorities above \r\nenergy efficiency \r\n• At the same time, every now and then there are some efforts to improve \r\nenergy efficiency in some cases. This is time consuming and requires \r\nexpertise. \r\n• How can we reuse these efforts?\r\n4\r\n\r\nEnergy Patterns for Mobile \r\nApps\r\nhttps://tqrg.github.io/energy-patterns/\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\n5.

[…] \r\n11\r\n\r\nDynamic Retry Delay\r\n• Context: […] In a mobile app, when a given resource is \r\nunavailable, the app will unnecessarily try to connect the resource \r\nfor a number of times, leading to unnecessary power consumption. \r\n• Solution: Increase retry interval after each failed connection. […]\r\n• Example: Consider a mobile app that provides a news feed and \r\nthe app is not able to reach the server to collect updates. […] use \r\nthe Fibonacci series to increase the time between attempts.\r\nWhenever an attempt to access a \r\nresource fails, increase the time \r\ninterval before retrying.\r\n12\r\n\r\nBatch Operations \r\n• Context: Executing operations separately leads to extraneous \r\ntail energy consumptions  \r\n• Solution: Bundle multiple operations in a single one.

Why?\r\n\r\nOne would expect zero carbon intensity from solar-\r\npanels or wind farms, but that’s not the case.\r\n⚠\r\n?\r\n\r\nMarginal Power Plant\r\n• Renewable-based power plants cannot adapt to demand. \r\n• When demand is higher than the existing power in the electricity grid, we \r\nneed a power plant that is able to scale up to that demand. \r\n• This is usually done by fossil-based power plants. They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat’s the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n• Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: “Literature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal “\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n• Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', '• Deadline April 4.\r\n6\r\n\r\nStrategy\r\n• Week 0 \r\n• Decide project idea (today) \r\n• Define steering meeting schedule \r\n• Create working document of the \r\narticle: Problem statement and solution \r\nproposal! \r\n• Define and assign tasks for each week. \r\n• Week 1 \r\n• Implementation \r\n• Agreements with supervisor. \r\n• Week 2 \r\n• Implementation \r\n• Week 3 \r\n• Implementation, Full draft of article, \r\ndissemination. \r\n• Week 4 \r\n• Final refinements \r\n• Prepare presentation\r\n7\r\n\r\nProject ideas\r\n• A1.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

This is a key aspect of sustainable software engineering, which aims to create long-term value while minimizing environmental impact. Adaptation can involve various strategies, such as:

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Developing software that is energy-efficient, which reduces the carbon footprint and conserves resources. This includes optimizing code, reducing computational demands, and using energy-efficient algorithms.

2. **Carbon-Aware Computing**: Implementing systems like Google's Carbon-Intelligent Computing System (CICS), which shifts datacenter jobs in time based on carbon intensity data to reduce emissions during peak carbon-intensive hours.

3. **Green AI**: Adopting practices that reduce the energy consumption of AI models, such as using pre-trained models, optimizing hyperparameters, and selecting green datacenters.

4. **Green Procurement**: Choosing software and service providers that prioritize sustainability, which encourages the industry to adopt greener practices.

5. **Compliance and Regulations**: Adapting to policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, such as the EU's goal to be carbon neutral by 2030, which affects the ICT sector.

By integrating these adaptive strategies, software developers can contribute to mitigating climate change while ensuring their systems remain efficient and sustainable.","The term 'adaption' is mentioned in the context of climate change, alongside other buzzwords such as eco-friendly, energy efficiency, and environmental responsibility."

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Energy Efficiency vs Code \r\nQuality\r\n\r\nMeasuring Maintainability\r\n• According to ISO/IEC 25010, Maintainability is “the degree of \r\neffectiveness and efficiency with which a software product or \r\nsystem can be modified to improve it, correct it or adapt it to \r\nchanges in environment, and in requirements” \r\n• We use the code analysis tool Better Code Hub to assess \r\nmaintainability \r\n• Better Code Hub maps the ISO/IEC 25010 standard on \r\nmaintainability into a set of guidelines derived from static analysis\r\n46\r\n\r\nMaintainability of Energy Changes\r\n• What is the impact of making energy-oriented code changes on \r\nthe maintainability of mobile apps?', 'CO2eq =\r\n∑\r\ng∈GHG\r\n(GWPg ⋅mg)\r\n23\r\nCO2eq = GWPCO2 ⋅mCO2 + GWPCH4 ⋅mCH4 + GWPN2O ⋅mN2O\r\n= 1 × 1000 + 21 × 20 + 310 × 5\r\n= 2670kgCO2eq\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- 100-GWP is only an estimation;  \r\n- different sources reveal different estimations; \r\n- there is also the 20-GWP and the 500-GWP. \r\nI use this source: Foster et al.

Why?\r\n\r\nOne would expect zero carbon intensity from solar-\r\npanels or wind farms, but that’s not the case.\r\n⚠\r\n?\r\n\r\nMarginal Power Plant\r\n• Renewable-based power plants cannot adapt to demand. \r\n• When demand is higher than the existing power in the electricity grid, we \r\nneed a power plant that is able to scale up to that demand. \r\n• This is usually done by fossil-based power plants. They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat’s the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n• Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: “Literature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal “\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n• Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', '• Improve parameter-tuning strategy.\r\n11\r\n\r\nReporting energy/carbon footprint\r\n• We need benchmarks. \r\n• AllenAI leaderboard\u2028\r\nhttps://leaderboard.allenai.org \r\n• No carbon metrics, yet \r\n• Report comparable proxies for energy \r\nconsumption. \r\n• ⚠ Learning algorithms behave in a non-\r\ndeterministic \r\n• ⚠ Different data-points lead to different \r\nenergy consumption\r\n12\r\n\r\nReporting energy/carbon footprint\r\n• Reporting measured energy consumption \r\n• + Accurate \r\n• + Easy to map to carbon emissions \r\n• - Hard to measure \r\n• - Low replicability \r\n• Reporting time / estimation based on time & hardware \r\n• + Easy to measure \r\n• + Correlates with energy consumption in most cases. \r\n• -  Difficult to compare with measurements from other setups \r\n• E.g., floating point operations (FPOs) (?) \r\n• + comparable across different setups \r\n• + cheap \r\n• - does not factor in memory energy consumption \r\n• - does not reflect carbon emissions\r\n13\r\n\r\nData-centric AI\r\n\r\nData-centric AI\r\n• Emerging discipline that deals with systematically engineering data to build AI \r\nsystems. \r\n• Shift from improving the training strategy to improving the data. \r\n• It is better to have small but reliable datasets than large but noisy \r\ndatasets. \r\n• => Improve data collection, data labelling, and data preprocessing. \r\n• More about data-centric AI by Andrew Ng:\u2028\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06-AZXmwHjo\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen Data-centric AI\r\n• How do different ML algorithms compare \r\nin terms of energy consumption? \r\n• How does number of rows relate to the \r\nenergy consumption of ML models? \r\n• How does number of features relate to \r\nthe energy consumption of ML models? \r\n• What is the impact of reducing data in the \r\nperformance of the model? \r\n• Method -> results -> discussion\r\n17\r\n\r\nMethod\r\n• Single object of study: natural language model to detect spam messages. \r\n• 6 machine learning algorithms: SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forrest, \r\nAdaBoost, Bagging Classifier. \r\n• Reduce the number of rows. 10%, 20%, .., 100% \r\n• Stratified random sampling (?) \r\n• Reduce the number of features. 10%, 20%, .., 100% \r\n• Feature importance metric based on the Chi-Square Test (Chi2) \r\n• Estimate energy consumption using a RAPL-based tool.

1. **Green Procurement**: Encourage customers and organizations to choose providers and partners that share their sustainability values. This includes buying green services/products, using green providers, and developers working for green companies. Green procurement makes environmental sustainability essential for economic sustainability.

2. **Compliance with Regulations**: Adhering to policies and regulations aimed at reducing carbon footprints, such as the EU's goal to be carbon neutral by 2030. This includes initiatives like extending smartphone lifetimes and supporting the right-to-repair movement.

3. **Green Software Development**: Focus on building energy-efficient software, especially for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices. This involves energy-efficiency testing and improvements.

4. **Green AI**: Adopt practices that reduce the energy consumption of AI systems, such as using green datacenters, running on low carbon intensity hours, and optimizing hardware and software for energy efficiency.

5. **Education and Awareness**: Educate software engineers and organizations about sustainable practices and the importance of reducing the environmental impact of software development.

6. **Innovation and Tools**: Develop tools and frameworks that help measure and reduce the energy consumption of software applications. This includes energy profiling tools and methodologies for debugging software energy consumption.

7. **Community Engagement**: Involve communities and organizations in sustainability initiatives, such as ClimateAction.tech and Green TU, to foster collaboration and innovation in sustainable practices.

By integrating these strategies, the software engineering industry can significantly reduce its environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future.","Driving sustainability in the software engineering industry involves implementing practices that reduce environmental impact, promote resource efficiency, and encourage ethical development processes."

Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal. Unless there’s a \r\ngood reason. \r\n• E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n• (It happens and that’s ok!)– consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy – falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n• If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.

E.g., reading an ebook in your \r\ncomputer. \r\n• Energy consumption makes sense in one-off use cases. E.g., energy \r\nconsumption of a bitcoin transaction. \r\n⚠\r\n\r\nLearning activity\r\n• Pair up with one colleague and discuss potential software use cases where \r\none should test energy efficiency. \r\n• Choose one use case where energy consumption is the best metric to \r\ndiscuss/test energy efficiency. \r\n• Choose one use case where average power consumption is the best \r\nmetric to discuss/test energy efficiency.\r\n13\r\n\r\nEnergy Delay Product (EDP)\r\n• In some cases, to achieve less energy consumption, one simply runs the \r\nsoftware on a low power mode of the CPU. \r\n• E.g., setting the CPU at a low frequency will make execution slow but more \r\nenergy-efficient. \r\n• Energy consumption metric that penalizes slow runs \r\n \r\n \r\n• Gives more importance to application runtime, with the goal of making both \r\nlow energy and fast runtime applications.', '• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Tools to Measure Software Energy \r\n(lab)\r\nSustainable Software Engineering\u2028\r\nCS4575\r\nSustainableSE 2025\r\nCarolin Brandt \r\nC.E.Brandt@tudelft.nl \r\nEnrique Barba Roque \r\nE.BarbaRoque@tudelft.nl\r\n\r\n1. Tools \r\n2. Hands-on \r\n3. Project 1\r\n\r\n3\r\nHardware Power \r\nMonitors\r\nEnergy Profilers\r\n\r\nHardware Power Monitors\r\n• Connects directly to the power source of the device/\r\ncomponent. \r\n• Some power monitors also replace the power source. \r\n• Example: \r\n• Monsoon Power Monitor (for IoT and smartphones).  \r\n• Can be fully automated using a Python API. \r\n• It measures and powers small electronic devices. \r\n• There are many power/energy meters out there but for \r\nsoftware use cases we need to be able to control them \r\nusing an API.\r\n4\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 1. Disassemble the smartphone and find the \r\nconnectors of the battery.  \r\n• iFixit usually has nice tutorials and blueprints. \r\nhttps://www.ifixit.com\r\n5\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 2. Extract the electronic component of the battery \r\n• Modern batteries are connected through 4 terminals: \r\n• Positive \r\n• Negative \r\n• BTEMP, battery temperature (used for safety) \r\n• BST, battery system indicator (provides info about \r\nthe battery) \r\n• Hence, one cannot simply connect + and - pins\r\n6\r\n\r\n• 3. Connect the electronic component \r\ndirectly to the monitor.\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n7\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 4. Use the library PyMonsoon to control the power \r\nmonitor. \r\n• https://github.com/msoon/PyMonsoon \r\n• 4.1. Set the monsoon to desired Voltage. Choose \r\nthe typical voltage of the original battery. For the \r\nNexus 5X, 3.8V was equivalent to its battery at \r\naround 60% capacity. \r\n• 4.2. Start measuring\r\n8\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 5. Automate User Interface interaction \r\n• The last thing you want to do is to manually interact with the smartphone \r\nwhile you measure energy consumption. Tests are less accurate, less \r\nreproducible, and, in this case, the screen cannot not be easily accessed. \r\n• Tools to automate interaction with Android phones: \r\n• To open, install, close apps: adb \r\n• To interact with the app: Appium, Robotium, UIAutomator, espresso, \r\netc. \r\n• Alternative: physalia is a library that automates all adb interactions and \r\nPyMonsoon calls.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIssue 1: USB cable!\r\n• You need the USB cable to automate the interaction with the phone. \r\n• When you connect the USB cable, measurements become\u2028\r\nunreliable. \r\n• Solution: \r\n• Monsoon has a feature to control the USB connection (switch on/off) \r\n• Option 1: Right before starting measurements, the USB connection is stopped. \r\n• Works fine when when all the interaction instructions can be sent in advance and the time for the \r\nexecution is already known. \r\n• Option 2: using USB, set up a wireless ADB connection. Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device. E.g., getting push notifications, \r\nchecking nearby bluetooth devices, etc. \r\n• Moreover, brightness may change according to environment. Different \r\nscreen brightness, different results.']","[""['The VW scandal\\nGreenwashing\\n• Used software to cheat on vehicle emissions \\ntests.\\n• The vehicle’s software could detect whether they \\nwere being tested, changing the performance \\naccordingly to improve results.\\n• Aﬀected 11M cars worldwide, 8M in Europe.\\n18']""]","The software in the VW scandal was designed to detect when vehicles were undergoing emissions testing and alter the performance of the vehicle to improve test results.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Why?\r\n\r\nOne would expect zero carbon intensity from solar-\r\npanels or wind farms, but that’s not the case.\r\n⚠\r\n?\r\n\r\nMarginal Power Plant\r\n• Renewable-based power plants cannot adapt to demand. \r\n• When demand is higher than the existing power in the electricity grid, we \r\nneed a power plant that is able to scale up to that demand. \r\n• This is usually done by fossil-based power plants. They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat’s the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n• Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: “Literature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal “\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n• Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', 'It’s more important that we learn how to \r\ndiscuss this topic and come up with new ideas than learning all the theory. \r\nCritical thinking over checkboxes. \r\n• Mix of content and discussion \r\n• Ultimately, the lectures aim to give you food for thought and the necessary \r\nknowledge to excel in Project 2.

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al. (2020)\r\n\r\nIssues of Red AI\r\n• High costs (hardware, electricity, data access, etc.) \r\n• Limited reproducibility.  \r\n• Energy consumption. \r\n• Carbon emissions. \r\n• SMEs can hardly be competitive. \r\n• Groundbreaking AI research is mostly done by tech giants.\r\n7\r\n\r\nA few examples of Red AI\r\n• Google’s BERT-large \r\n• 350 million features \r\n• Trained for 2.5 days using 512 TPU chips, costing $60K+ \r\n• Open-GPT3 (now GPT-4/o1) \r\n• 550 tonnes CO2-eq (Patterson, 2021) \r\n• 175 billion features \r\n• API is open but no-pretrained model is available \r\n• AlphaGo \r\n• 1920 CPUs, 280 GPUs, costing $35M\r\n8\r\n\r\nRed AI in Large Language Models (LLMs)\r\n• OPT by Meta reports 75 tons CO2-eq (1/7 of OpenGPT’s footprint).\u2028\r\n(Also 175billion params) \r\n• However, Llama 3 reported 2,290 tons of CO2-eq (7.7M GPU hours \r\ntraining ) \r\n• Open science: release includes both the pretrained models and the code \r\nneeded to train and use them. \r\n• DeepSeek-V3 claims “only” 2.78M GPU hours \r\n• Bloom by Huggingface reports 25 tons, 51 when considering embodied \r\nand operational carbon footprint.

Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device.

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Automate User Interface interaction \r\n• The last thing you want to do is to manually interact with the smartphone \r\nwhile you measure energy consumption. Tests are less accurate, less \r\nreproducible, and, in this case, the screen cannot not be easily accessed. \r\n• Tools to automate interaction with Android phones: \r\n• To open, install, close apps: adb \r\n• To interact with the app: Appium, Robotium, UIAutomator, espresso, \r\netc. \r\n• Alternative: physalia is a library that automates all adb interactions and \r\nPyMonsoon calls.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIssue 1: USB cable!\r\n• You need the USB cable to automate the interaction with the phone. \r\n• When you connect the USB cable, measurements become\u2028\r\nunreliable. \r\n• Solution: \r\n• Monsoon has a feature to control the USB connection (switch on/off) \r\n• Option 1: Right before starting measurements, the USB connection is stopped. \r\n• Works fine when when all the interaction instructions can be sent in advance and the time for the \r\nexecution is already known. \r\n• Option 2: using USB, set up a wireless ADB connection. Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device.

It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Aka 100-global-warming \r\npotential (100-GWP). \r\n \r\n \r\n• Co2-eq is expressed in mass – e.g., \r\nCO2eq =\r\n∑\r\ng∈GHG\r\n(GWPg ⋅mg)\r\nkgCO2eq\r\n22\r\n\r\nCarbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2-eq)\r\n \r\n \r\n• As an example, imagine that to run our software system \r\nour electricity provider emits 1000Kg of CO2, 20Kg of \r\nCH4, 5Kg of N2O, 0Kg of the remaining GHG.\r\nCO2eq =\r\n∑\r\ng∈GHG\r\n(GWPg ⋅mg)\r\n23\r\nCO2eq = GWPCO2 ⋅mCO2 + GWPCH4 ⋅mCH4 + GWPN2O ⋅mN2O\r\n= 1 × 1000 + 21 × 20 + 310 × 5\r\n= 2670kgCO2eq\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n- 100-GWP is only an estimation;  \r\n- different sources reveal different estimations; \r\n- there is also the 20-GWP and the 500-GWP. \r\nI use this source: Foster et al.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

1. **Asset Management**: Efficiently manage and utilize assets to maximize their value and contribution to the company's operations. This includes regular maintenance, upgrades, and strategic allocation of resources.

2. **Capital Investment**: Make informed decisions about where to invest capital to generate the highest returns. This involves evaluating potential projects, understanding market trends, and assessing risks.

3. **Profitability Analysis**: Continuously analyze the profitability of different business segments and products to identify areas for improvement and ensure that resources are allocated to the most profitable ventures.

4. **Cost Management**: Implement effective cost control measures to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve the overall efficiency of operations.

5. **Funding and Financing**: Secure appropriate funding and financing options to support growth initiatives while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. This includes managing debt levels and exploring equity financing if necessary.

6. **Risk Management**: Identify and mitigate financial risks that could impact the company's assets and capital. This includes market risks, credit risks, and operational risks.

7. **Compliance and Regulations**: Ensure compliance with financial regulations and standards to avoid legal issues and potential fines that could affect profitability.

8. **Sustainability**: Consider the long-term sustainability of investments and operations, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, which can impact the company's reputation and financial performance.

By focusing on these areas, a company can effectively manage its assets and capital to create value and achieve profitability.","When managing assets and capital, a company should consider wealth creation, prosperity, profitability, capital investment, income, the number of customers, man-day-rate estimates, the next round of funding, and meeting requirements in contracts."

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money.

1. **Green Procurement**: Organizations can choose providers that share their values on sustainability. This includes customers buying green services/products, companies using green providers, and developers working for green companies. Green procurement makes environmental sustainability essential for economic sustainability.

2. **Sustainability via Compliance**: Adhering to regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing carbon footprints, such as the EU's goal to be carbon neutral by 2030, can drive sustainability. This includes extending the lifespan of devices and supporting the right-to-repair movement.

3. **Energy Efficiency and Green Software**: Building energy-efficient software is crucial. This involves developing software that runs efficiently on limited power resources, such as smartphones and IoT devices, and conducting energy-efficiency testing and improvements.

4. **Carbon-aware Datacenters**: Utilizing datacenters that operate on low carbon intensity hours and selecting green datacenters can reduce the carbon footprint of software operations.

5. **Green AI Practices**: Implementing practices such as using pre-trained models, optimizing hyperparameter tuning, and adopting data-centric AI approaches can reduce the energy consumption of AI systems.

6. **Education and Awareness**: Educating software engineers and stakeholders about sustainable practices and the importance of reducing the environmental impact of software development can foster a culture of sustainability.

7. **Reporting and Benchmarking**: Establishing benchmarks for energy and carbon metrics and reporting these metrics can help in assessing and improving the sustainability of software systems.

By integrating these approaches, the software engineering industry can significantly contribute to environmental sustainability.","Driving sustainability in the software engineering industry involves implementing practices that reduce the environmental impact of software development and operation, promote resource efficiency, and consider the entire lifecycle of software systems."

Create a reproducible scenario of the execution of your software. Preferably \r\nthis should be an automated script – e.g., using a bash or python script. \r\n2. Execute the scenario in a version of your software. Use the energy profiler to \r\nmeasure the energy consumption. \r\n3. Improve your software in parts of the code that you suspect have low \r\nperformance. \r\n4. Execute the same scenario with the new version. Compare the energy data \r\nin this version with the previous one.\u2028\r\nEnergy is lower, test passes; energy is higher test fails.\r\n22\r\n\r\nHands-on 2\r\n• Create a reproducible scenario. (Usually easier with command-line interfaces) \r\n• Automatically start/stop energy profiling.\r\n23\r\n\r\nProject 1\r\n• Deadline: March 1 \r\n•  Compare energy consumption in common software use cases. \r\n• Examples: \r\n• Different versions of the same app; \r\n• Same use case but different apps \r\n• Same version, same app, but different user settings (e.g., enable/disable GPU optimisation) \r\n• Same version, same app, but different running environment \r\n• Submission via PR (markdown). \r\n• Blog-style report (markdown, approx 2500 words). \r\n• Replication package. \r\n• Points if the experiment is automated.', 'Carbon-free giants\r\n• Google, Microsoft, Meta/Facebook want to be carbon free by 2030 \r\n• Carbon free is different from carbon neutral \r\n• Green IT experts are needed to meet these goals\r\n23\r\n\r\n\r\nRebound effect*\r\n• Energy consumption decreases ↓↓ but demand also increases ↑↑. \r\n• *a.k.a.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

E.g., reading an ebook in your \r\ncomputer. \r\n• Energy consumption makes sense in one-off use cases. E.g., energy \r\nconsumption of a bitcoin transaction. \r\n⚠\r\n\r\nLearning activity\r\n• Pair up with one colleague and discuss potential software use cases where \r\none should test energy efficiency. \r\n• Choose one use case where energy consumption is the best metric to \r\ndiscuss/test energy efficiency. \r\n• Choose one use case where average power consumption is the best \r\nmetric to discuss/test energy efficiency.\r\n13\r\n\r\nEnergy Delay Product (EDP)\r\n• In some cases, to achieve less energy consumption, one simply runs the \r\nsoftware on a low power mode of the CPU. \r\n• E.g., setting the CPU at a low frequency will make execution slow but more \r\nenergy-efficient. \r\n• Energy consumption metric that penalizes slow runs \r\n \r\n \r\n• Gives more importance to application runtime, with the goal of making both \r\nlow energy and fast runtime applications.\r\nEDP = E × t = ΔP × t2\r\n14\r\n\r\nmAh\r\njoules\r\nmilliampere hour\r\nmobile industry\r\nThis is not energy or power. \r\nIt is a unit of electric charge.\r\nThe typical notebook battery has between 2,000 \r\nand 6,000 milliamp hours (mAh)\r\n?\r\n\r\nElectric charge\r\n• International System of Units (SI): Coulomb (C). \r\n• 1 electron has 1.602176634×10-19 coulombs. Moving the electron around the electric \r\nfield requires work (energy consumption).  \r\n• mAh is the most common metric to specify the capacity of batteries. \r\n• 1 mAh = 3.6C \r\n• To compute the actual energy of a battery we need to factor in voltage: \r\n \r\n  \r\n• E.g., for a battery with a capacity of 1000mAh: \r\n \r\nEnergy = Voltage × Charge\r\n1000mAh × 3.8V = 3800mWh = 3.8Wh = 3.8 × 3600J = 13680J\r\n16\r\n\r\nWhy do we use charge units for batteries?\r\n• There is a continuous change of voltage throughout a charge/discharge \r\ncycle. \r\n• E.g., it can start with 4.5 V at a “100%” capacity and from to 3.0V at 5% \r\ncapacity. \r\n• Most devices use voltage to compute their battery level percentage.\r\n17\r\n\r\nInternational System of Units (SI)\r\n• Energy: Joule \r\n• Power: Watt \r\n• Charge: Coulomb \r\n• (Time: second)\r\n18\r\n\r\nSI Units are difficult to grasp\r\n• Whenever talking to a general audience use relative units: \r\n• Compare to the other well-known things: \r\n• Yearly household energy consumption \r\n• Yearly country electrical energy consumption.\u2028\r\n(e.g., https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons) \r\n• Driving kms with a standard car \r\n• Percentage of a normal battery charge cycle. \r\n• Compare to other software artefacts/usecases: \r\n• E.g, percentage of Version A over Version B.', ""• 6 machine learning algorithms: SVM, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forrest, \r\nAdaBoost, Bagging Classifier. \r\n• Reduce the number of rows. 10%, 20%, .., 100% \r\n• Stratified random sampling (?) \r\n• Reduce the number of features. 10%, 20%, .., 100% \r\n• Feature importance metric based on the Chi-Square Test (Chi2) \r\n• Estimate energy consumption using a RAPL-based tool.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', 'p-value = 0.04\r\nOn average, version B spent less energy than version A  —  ✅ \r\nThere is statistical significance —  ✅ \r\nEffect size, percent-change is ≈1% — 🤔 \r\n⚠ Do we care?\r\n(?)\r\n\r\nPractical Significance\r\n• Depending on the case, a 2% improvement might be either wonderful or completely \r\nuseless. \r\n• Effect size analyses help assess practical significance but might not be enough. \r\n• A critical discussion always needs to be performed.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Project 1\r\n\r\n3\r\nHardware Power \r\nMonitors\r\nEnergy Profilers\r\n\r\nHardware Power Monitors\r\n• Connects directly to the power source of the device/\r\ncomponent. \r\n• Some power monitors also replace the power source. \r\n• Example: \r\n• Monsoon Power Monitor (for IoT and smartphones).  \r\n• Can be fully automated using a Python API. \r\n• It measures and powers small electronic devices. \r\n• There are many power/energy meters out there but for \r\nsoftware use cases we need to be able to control them \r\nusing an API.\r\n4\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 1. Disassemble the smartphone and find the \r\nconnectors of the battery.  \r\n• iFixit usually has nice tutorials and blueprints. \r\nhttps://www.ifixit.com\r\n5\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 2. Extract the electronic component of the battery \r\n• Modern batteries are connected through 4 terminals: \r\n• Positive \r\n• Negative \r\n• BTEMP, battery temperature (used for safety) \r\n• BST, battery system indicator (provides info about \r\nthe battery) \r\n• Hence, one cannot simply connect + and - pins\r\n6\r\n\r\n• 3. Connect the electronic component \r\ndirectly to the monitor.\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n7\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 4. Use the library PyMonsoon to control the power \r\nmonitor. \r\n• https://github.com/msoon/PyMonsoon \r\n• 4.1. Set the monsoon to desired Voltage. Choose \r\nthe typical voltage of the original battery. For the \r\nNexus 5X, 3.8V was equivalent to its battery at \r\naround 60% capacity. \r\n• 4.2. Start measuring\r\n8\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 5. Automate User Interface interaction \r\n• The last thing you want to do is to manually interact with the smartphone \r\nwhile you measure energy consumption. Tests are less accurate, less \r\nreproducible, and, in this case, the screen cannot not be easily accessed. \r\n• Tools to automate interaction with Android phones: \r\n• To open, install, close apps: adb \r\n• To interact with the app: Appium, Robotium, UIAutomator, espresso, \r\netc. \r\n• Alternative: physalia is a library that automates all adb interactions and \r\nPyMonsoon calls.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIssue 1: USB cable!\r\n• You need the USB cable to automate the interaction with the phone. \r\n• When you connect the USB cable, measurements become\u2028\r\nunreliable. \r\n• Solution: \r\n• Monsoon has a feature to control the USB connection (switch on/off) \r\n• Option 1: Right before starting measurements, the USB connection is stopped. \r\n• Works fine when when all the interaction instructions can be sent in advance and the time for the \r\nexecution is already known. \r\n• Option 2: using USB, set up a wireless ADB connection. Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device. E.g., getting push notifications, \r\nchecking nearby bluetooth devices, etc. \r\n• Moreover, brightness may change according to environment. Different \r\nscreen brightness, different results.', '5.

E.g., reading an ebook in your \r\ncomputer. \r\n• Energy consumption makes sense in one-off use cases. E.g., energy \r\nconsumption of a bitcoin transaction. \r\n⚠\r\n\r\nLearning activity\r\n• Pair up with one colleague and discuss potential software use cases where \r\none should test energy efficiency. \r\n• Choose one use case where energy consumption is the best metric to \r\ndiscuss/test energy efficiency. \r\n• Choose one use case where average power consumption is the best \r\nmetric to discuss/test energy efficiency.\r\n13\r\n\r\nEnergy Delay Product (EDP)\r\n• In some cases, to achieve less energy consumption, one simply runs the \r\nsoftware on a low power mode of the CPU. \r\n• E.g., setting the CPU at a low frequency will make execution slow but more \r\nenergy-efficient. \r\n• Energy consumption metric that penalizes slow runs \r\n \r\n \r\n• Gives more importance to application runtime, with the goal of making both \r\nlow energy and fast runtime applications.', '• Collect the energy data of using Coral BodyPix for 30 seconds.\u2028\r\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/body-pix/index.html \r\n• Report the total energy consumption. \r\n• Extra-mile: \r\n• Compare the energy consumption in different browsers. \r\n• Check the spikes and drops in Power and Temperature.\r\n20\r\n\r\nRetrospection\r\nHands-on 1\r\n• Are the measurements repeatable? \r\n• What were the confounding factors? \r\n• How can we automate this process?\r\n21\r\n\r\nEnergy testing\r\n(Different from energy monitoring)\r\n1. Create a reproducible scenario of the execution of your software. Preferably \r\nthis should be an automated script – e.g., using a bash or python script. \r\n2. Execute the scenario in a version of your software. Use the energy profiler to \r\nmeasure the energy consumption. \r\n3. Improve your software in parts of the code that you suspect have low \r\nperformance. \r\n4. Execute the same scenario with the new version. Compare the energy data \r\nin this version with the previous one.\u2028\r\nEnergy is lower, test passes; energy is higher test fails.\r\n22\r\n\r\nHands-on 2\r\n• Create a reproducible scenario. (Usually easier with command-line interfaces) \r\n• Automatically start/stop energy profiling.\r\n23\r\n\r\nProject 1\r\n• Deadline: March 1 \r\n•  Compare energy consumption in common software use cases. \r\n• Examples: \r\n• Different versions of the same app; \r\n• Same use case but different apps \r\n• Same version, same app, but different user settings (e.g., enable/disable GPU optimisation) \r\n• Same version, same app, but different running environment \r\n• Submission via PR (markdown). \r\n• Blog-style report (markdown, approx 2500 words). \r\n• Replication package. \r\n• Points if the experiment is automated.\r\n24\r\n\r\nGroup registration\r\n• Brightspace > Collaboration > Groups and sign up for one of the groups \r\nunder ""Project Groups (P1 and P2)""  \r\n• If you are looking for a group or teamembers, use the mattermost channel \r\n“~Searching-group-members”. \r\n• The deadline for self-registering as a group is end of this week, so by Sunday, \r\n16th of February, 23:59. \r\n• We might do final adjustments afterwards.\r\n25\r\n\r\n26\r\nKay Singh.

Scientific guide for energy measurements \r\n2. Energy consumption data analysis \r\n\r\nEnergy tests are flaky\r\n• Multiple runs might yield different results \r\n• There are many confounding factors that need to be controlled/minimized.\r\n3\r\n?\r\n\r\nZen mode 🧘\r\n• Close all applications. \r\n• Turn off notifications. \r\n• Only the required hardware should be connected (avoid USB drives, external \r\ndisks, external displays, etc.). \r\n• Kill unnecessary services running in the background (e.g., web server, file \r\nsharing, etc.). \r\n• If you do not need an internet or intranet connection, switch off your network. \r\n• Prefer cable over wireless – the energy consumption from a cable connection \r\nis more stable than from a wireless connection.\r\n4\r\n\r\nFreeze and report your settings 🥶\r\n• Fix display brightness; switch off auto brightness \r\n• If Wifi is on, it should always be on, connected to the same network/\r\nendpoint.…\r\n5\r\n\r\nWarm-up 📶\r\n• Energy consumption is highly affected by the temperature of your hardware. \r\n• Higher the temperature -> higher the resistance of electrical conductors ->\u2028\r\n-> higher dissipation -> higher energy consumption \r\n• The first execution will appear more efficient because the hardware is still \r\ncold. \r\n• Run a CPU-intensive task before measuring energy consumption. E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1.

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al. (2020)\r\n\r\nIssues of Red AI\r\n• High costs (hardware, electricity, data access, etc.) \r\n• Limited reproducibility.  \r\n• Energy consumption. \r\n• Carbon emissions. \r\n• SMEs can hardly be competitive. \r\n• Groundbreaking AI research is mostly done by tech giants.\r\n7\r\n\r\nA few examples of Red AI\r\n• Google’s BERT-large \r\n• 350 million features \r\n• Trained for 2.5 days using 512 TPU chips, costing $60K+ \r\n• Open-GPT3 (now GPT-4/o1) \r\n• 550 tonnes CO2-eq (Patterson, 2021) \r\n• 175 billion features \r\n• API is open but no-pretrained model is available \r\n• AlphaGo \r\n• 1920 CPUs, 280 GPUs, costing $35M\r\n8\r\n\r\nRed AI in Large Language Models (LLMs)\r\n• OPT by Meta reports 75 tons CO2-eq (1/7 of OpenGPT’s footprint).\u2028\r\n(Also 175billion params) \r\n• However, Llama 3 reported 2,290 tons of CO2-eq (7.7M GPU hours \r\ntraining ) \r\n• Open science: release includes both the pretrained models and the code \r\nneeded to train and use them. \r\n• DeepSeek-V3 claims “only” 2.78M GPU hours \r\n• Bloom by Huggingface reports 25 tons, 51 when considering embodied \r\nand operational carbon footprint.

E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

It focuses on several dimensions, including economical, social, technical, individual, and environmental aspects.

In terms of environmental sustainability, it involves developing software that has minimal impact on the planet throughout its lifecycle. This includes considering energy efficiency, reducing e-waste, and ensuring that software systems are designed to be environmentally responsible. Sustainable Software Engineering also aligns with concepts like Green Software, which emphasizes building energy-efficient software, especially for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices.

By focusing on these aspects, Sustainable Software Engineering contributes to creating long-term value by ensuring that software systems are not only economically viable but also socially and environmentally responsible. This approach helps in reducing the carbon footprint of software systems, promoting energy efficiency, and supporting the broader goals of sustainability in technology.",Sustainable Software Engineering is the discipline that studies the process of creating software systems that are able to create value in the long term without hindering its surrounding environment.

E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy.

Energy consumption data analysis \r\n\r\nEnergy tests are flaky\r\n• Multiple runs might yield different results \r\n• There are many confounding factors that need to be controlled/minimized.\r\n3\r\n?\r\n\r\nZen mode 🧘\r\n• Close all applications. \r\n• Turn off notifications. \r\n• Only the required hardware should be connected (avoid USB drives, external \r\ndisks, external displays, etc.). \r\n• Kill unnecessary services running in the background (e.g., web server, file \r\nsharing, etc.). \r\n• If you do not need an internet or intranet connection, switch off your network. \r\n• Prefer cable over wireless – the energy consumption from a cable connection \r\nis more stable than from a wireless connection.\r\n4\r\n\r\nFreeze and report your settings 🥶\r\n• Fix display brightness; switch off auto brightness \r\n• If Wifi is on, it should always be on, connected to the same network/\r\nendpoint.…\r\n5\r\n\r\nWarm-up 📶\r\n• Energy consumption is highly affected by the temperature of your hardware. \r\n• Higher the temperature -> higher the resistance of electrical conductors ->\u2028\r\n-> higher dissipation -> higher energy consumption \r\n• The first execution will appear more efficient because the hardware is still \r\ncold. \r\n• Run a CPU-intensive task before measuring energy consumption. E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal.']","[""['https://www.menti.com/uns9d89kzn\\nWhat is Sustainable \\nSoftware Engineering?\\n?\\n6']""]","Sustainable Software Engineering is the discipline that studies the process of creating software systems that are able to create value in the long term without hindering their surrounding environment.

schedulers use a metric of cluster capacity to schedule a job in \r\na particular cluster. \r\n• CICS overrides this metric with the virtual capacity curve (VCC) that \r\nfactors in Carbon intensity \r\n• When a new job comes in, the scheduler estimates its CPU load and power \r\nusage and assigns it to a cluster if the VCC is not exceeded.\r\n23\r\n\r\n• Jobs are divided between flexible and inflexible. \r\n• Flexible load is considered shapeable/shiftable as long as its total daily \r\ncompute (CPU) demand is preserved \r\n• The system needs to consider that, while running a job, the virtual capacity \r\ncurve (VCC) might drop. Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

As a result, the total energy consumption may not decrease as much as expected, or it might even increase. This effect occurs because the cost savings from improved efficiency can lead to increased usage, either because the service becomes cheaper or because it enables new uses.

It is called a paradox because, intuitively, one would expect that making a process more energy-efficient would lead to a straightforward reduction in total energy consumption. However, the opposite can occur due to increased demand, which contradicts the initial expectation.","The Rebound effect, also known as Jevons Paradox in economics and Downs–Thomson paradox in mobility, occurs when energy consumption decreases but demand increases.

It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal. Unless there’s a \r\ngood reason. \r\n• E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n• (It happens and that’s ok!)– consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy – falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n• If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.

Energy consumption data analysis \r\n\r\nEnergy tests are flaky\r\n• Multiple runs might yield different results \r\n• There are many confounding factors that need to be controlled/minimized.\r\n3\r\n?\r\n\r\nZen mode 🧘\r\n• Close all applications. \r\n• Turn off notifications. \r\n• Only the required hardware should be connected (avoid USB drives, external \r\ndisks, external displays, etc.). \r\n• Kill unnecessary services running in the background (e.g., web server, file \r\nsharing, etc.). \r\n• If you do not need an internet or intranet connection, switch off your network. \r\n• Prefer cable over wireless – the energy consumption from a cable connection \r\nis more stable than from a wireless connection.\r\n4\r\n\r\nFreeze and report your settings 🥶\r\n• Fix display brightness; switch off auto brightness \r\n• If Wifi is on, it should always be on, connected to the same network/\r\nendpoint.…\r\n5\r\n\r\nWarm-up 📶\r\n• Energy consumption is highly affected by the temperature of your hardware. \r\n• Higher the temperature -> higher the resistance of electrical conductors ->\u2028\r\n-> higher dissipation -> higher energy consumption \r\n• The first execution will appear more efficient because the hardware is still \r\ncold. \r\n• Run a CPU-intensive task before measuring energy consumption. E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1.

It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1.

Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal. Unless there’s a \r\ngood reason. \r\n• E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n• (It happens and that’s ok!)– consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy – falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n• If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', '27\r\n\r\nCarbon intensity\r\n• How much carbon is emitted per kWh of electricity consumed. \r\n• The common unit: \r\n 🤷 \r\n• E.g.,  gas-based power plants emit less carbon than coal-based plants. \r\n• The power grid is a mix between different sources of electricity – different \r\nlocations have different carbon intensity.\r\ngCO2eq/kWh\r\n28\r\n\r\nhttps://app.electricitymaps.com/map\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\n📝 Reducing software energy consumption can help reduce the carbon intensity.

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat’s the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n• Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: “Literature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal “\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n• Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.\r\n\r\nRecap\r\n• Power \r\n• Energy \r\n• Average Power \r\n• Energy Delay Product \r\n• Electric charge (battery capacity) \r\n• Carbon dioxide equivalent (carbon emissions) \r\n• 100-global-warming potential \r\n• Carbon Intensity \r\n• Marginal Carbon Intensity\r\n37\r\n?\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n• Blog post on energy units:\u2028\r\nhttps://luiscruz.github.io/2023/05/13/energy-units.html \r\n38\r\n?', '8\r\n\r\nhttps://tqrg.github.io/energy-patterns\r\n\r\nDark UI Colors \r\nProvide a dark UI color theme to \r\nsave battery on devices with \r\nAMOLED screens.\r\n• Context: […] Apps that require heavy usage of screen can \r\nhave a substantial negative impact on battery life. \r\n• Solution: Provide a UI theme with dark background colors.

Scientific guide for energy measurements \r\n2. Energy consumption data analysis \r\n\r\nEnergy tests are flaky\r\n• Multiple runs might yield different results \r\n• There are many confounding factors that need to be controlled/minimized.\r\n3\r\n?\r\n\r\nZen mode 🧘\r\n• Close all applications. \r\n• Turn off notifications. \r\n• Only the required hardware should be connected (avoid USB drives, external \r\ndisks, external displays, etc.). \r\n• Kill unnecessary services running in the background (e.g., web server, file \r\nsharing, etc.). \r\n• If you do not need an internet or intranet connection, switch off your network. \r\n• Prefer cable over wireless – the energy consumption from a cable connection \r\nis more stable than from a wireless connection.\r\n4\r\n\r\nFreeze and report your settings 🥶\r\n• Fix display brightness; switch off auto brightness \r\n• If Wifi is on, it should always be on, connected to the same network/\r\nendpoint.…\r\n5\r\n\r\nWarm-up 📶\r\n• Energy consumption is highly affected by the temperature of your hardware. \r\n• Higher the temperature -> higher the resistance of electrical conductors ->\u2028\r\n-> higher dissipation -> higher energy consumption \r\n• The first execution will appear more efficient because the hardware is still \r\ncold. \r\n• Run a CPU-intensive task before measuring energy consumption. E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

This includes considering the environmental effects at various stages such as development, usage, and servicing, as well as addressing issues like e-waste. Green Software is closely related and focuses on sustainability and energy efficiency. It emphasizes building energy-efficient software, which is crucial for devices with limited power resources like smartphones and IoT devices. By improving energy efficiency, Green Software contributes to Environmental Sustainability by reducing the environmental footprint, such as fewer battery cycles and less energy consumption, which in turn supports user experience by reducing the need for frequent recharging.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat’s the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n• Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: “Literature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal “\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n• Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.\r\n\r\nRecap\r\n• Power \r\n• Energy \r\n• Average Power \r\n• Energy Delay Product \r\n• Electric charge (battery capacity) \r\n• Carbon dioxide equivalent (carbon emissions) \r\n• 100-global-warming potential \r\n• Carbon Intensity \r\n• Marginal Carbon Intensity\r\n37\r\n?\r\n\r\nFurther Reading\r\n• Blog post on energy units:\u2028\r\nhttps://luiscruz.github.io/2023/05/13/energy-units.html \r\n38\r\n?', 'Energy profiling of static analysis tools\r\n• What is the energy consumption of a ""typical run"" for a few OSS projects? \r\n• Does the type of analysis matter?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there

E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1.

[…]\r\n• Example: In a reading app, provide a theme with a dark \r\nbackground using light colors to display text. […] \r\n11\r\n\r\nDynamic Retry Delay\r\n• Context: […] In a mobile app, when a given resource is \r\nunavailable, the app will unnecessarily try to connect the resource \r\nfor a number of times, leading to unnecessary power consumption. \r\n• Solution: Increase retry interval after each failed connection. […]\r\n• Example: Consider a mobile app that provides a news feed and \r\nthe app is not able to reach the server to collect updates. […] use \r\nthe Fibonacci series to increase the time between attempts.\r\nWhenever an attempt to access a \r\nresource fails, increase the time \r\ninterval before retrying.\r\n12\r\n\r\nBatch Operations \r\n• Context: Executing operations separately leads to extraneous \r\ntail energy consumptions  \r\n• Solution: Bundle multiple operations in a single one. […]\r\n• Example: Use system provided APIs to schedule background \r\ntasks. These APIs, guarantee that device will exit sleep mode \r\nonly when there is a reasonable amount of work to do or when a \r\ngiven task is urgent.', '• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal. Unless there’s a \r\ngood reason. \r\n• E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n• (It happens and that’s ok!)– consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy – falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n• If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal. (e.g., \r\nin AI, executions are rarely deterministic). ⚠ Only after ruling out the previous \r\npoints.\r\n| ¯x −x| > 3s\r\n18\r\n\r\nHow do we know whether data is Normal?', '• Groundbreaking AI research is mostly done by tech giants.\r\n7\r\n\r\nA few examples of Red AI\r\n• Google’s BERT-large \r\n• 350 million features \r\n• Trained for 2.5 days using 512 TPU chips, costing $60K+ \r\n• Open-GPT3 (now GPT-4/o1) \r\n• 550 tonnes CO2-eq (Patterson, 2021) \r\n• 175 billion features \r\n• API is open but no-pretrained model is available \r\n• AlphaGo \r\n• 1920 CPUs, 280 GPUs, costing $35M\r\n8\r\n\r\nRed AI in Large Language Models (LLMs)\r\n• OPT by Meta reports 75 tons CO2-eq (1/7 of OpenGPT’s footprint).\u2028\r\n(Also 175billion params) \r\n• However, Llama 3 reported 2,290 tons of CO2-eq (7.7M GPU hours \r\ntraining ) \r\n• Open science: release includes both the pretrained models and the code \r\nneeded to train and use them. \r\n• DeepSeek-V3 claims “only” 2.78M GPU hours \r\n• Bloom by Huggingface reports 25 tons, 51 when considering embodied \r\nand operational carbon footprint.

E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1.

Disassemble the smartphone and find the \r\nconnectors of the battery.  \r\n• iFixit usually has nice tutorials and blueprints. \r\nhttps://www.ifixit.com\r\n5\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 2. Extract the electronic component of the battery \r\n• Modern batteries are connected through 4 terminals: \r\n• Positive \r\n• Negative \r\n• BTEMP, battery temperature (used for safety) \r\n• BST, battery system indicator (provides info about \r\nthe battery) \r\n• Hence, one cannot simply connect + and - pins\r\n6\r\n\r\n• 3.

Use the library PyMonsoon to control the power \r\nmonitor. \r\n• https://github.com/msoon/PyMonsoon \r\n• 4.1. Set the monsoon to desired Voltage. Choose \r\nthe typical voltage of the original battery. For the \r\nNexus 5X, 3.8V was equivalent to its battery at \r\naround 60% capacity. \r\n• 4.2. Start measuring\r\n8\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 5. Automate User Interface interaction \r\n• The last thing you want to do is to manually interact with the smartphone \r\nwhile you measure energy consumption. Tests are less accurate, less \r\nreproducible, and, in this case, the screen cannot not be easily accessed. \r\n• Tools to automate interaction with Android phones: \r\n• To open, install, close apps: adb \r\n• To interact with the app: Appium, Robotium, UIAutomator, espresso, \r\netc. \r\n• Alternative: physalia is a library that automates all adb interactions and \r\nPyMonsoon calls.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIssue 1: USB cable!\r\n• You need the USB cable to automate the interaction with the phone. \r\n• When you connect the USB cable, measurements become\u2028\r\nunreliable. \r\n• Solution: \r\n• Monsoon has a feature to control the USB connection (switch on/off) \r\n• Option 1: Right before starting measurements, the USB connection is stopped. \r\n• Works fine when when all the interaction instructions can be sent in advance and the time for the \r\nexecution is already known. \r\n• Option 2: using USB, set up a wireless ADB connection. Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device. E.g., getting push notifications, \r\nchecking nearby bluetooth devices, etc. \r\n• Moreover, brightness may change according to environment. Different \r\nscreen brightness, different results.', '• Comparing different programming languages is not an easy task. \r\n• They differ in many mechanisms: \r\n• Interpreted vs Compiled \r\n• Optimisations at the compiler level \r\n• Virtual machine \r\n• Garbage collector \r\n• Available libraries\r\n30\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n• Can we compare the energy efficiency of software languages?  \r\n• Is the faster language always the most energy efficient? \r\n• How does memory usage relate to energy consumption?

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', '•RQ3: Can we verify the \r\norigin of energy \r\nconsumption differences by \r\nrecreating the workload \r\nbehavior closely?\r\n37\r\n\r\nTracing\r\n• Find libc function running at the end of the benchmark \r\n• Tracing: Capture calls made to libc \r\n• Introduces non-linear overhead\r\n38\r\n\r\nSynchronization\r\n• Tracing slows down execution and increase energy consumption \r\n• Run separately and synchronize with logs\r\n39\r\n\r\nTracing Analysis\r\n40\r\n\r\nTracing Analysis\r\n41\r\n\r\nBenchmarking memcpy\r\n• Copy bytes from one part of memory to \r\nanother \r\n• Depending on function parameters, different \r\nassembly-level optimizations \r\n• Some not included in musl\r\n42\r\n\r\nBenchmarking memcpy\r\n• Copy 4 bytes from fixed \r\npointer to moving pointer \r\n• (100,300,500,600) x 1M \r\nrequests \r\n•  15% more power and 3X time\r\n43\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n• Significant difference in energy consumption for memcpy \r\n• 8.6% difference for Redis workload and 13% in our benchmark \r\n• musl trades performance for a smaller codebase \r\n• No official documentation \r\n• No awareness about energy performance\r\n44\r\n\r\n5.

These APIs, guarantee that device will exit sleep mode \r\nonly when there is a reasonable amount of work to do or when a \r\ngiven task is urgent.', 'google.com/view/energy-efficiency-languages\r\n21\r\nAna Radovanovic ́, Ross Koningstein, Ian Schneider, Bokan \r\nChen, Alexandre Duarte, Binz Roy, Diyue Xiao, Maya \r\nHaridasan, Patrick Hung, Nick Care, Saurav Talukdar, Eric \r\nMullen, Kendal Smith, MariEllen Cottman, and Walfredo Cirne \r\n\r\n\r\n• Google’s Carbon-Intelligent Computing System (CICS) \r\n• Main idea: use carbon-intensity data to shift datacenter jobs in time \r\n• Typically, job schedulers use a metric of cluster capacity to schedule a job in \r\na particular cluster. \r\n• CICS overrides this metric with the virtual capacity curve (VCC) that \r\nfactors in Carbon intensity \r\n• When a new job comes in, the scheduler estimates its CPU load and power \r\nusage and assigns it to a cluster if the VCC is not exceeded.\r\n23\r\n\r\n• Jobs are divided between flexible and inflexible. \r\n• Flexible load is considered shapeable/shiftable as long as its total daily \r\ncompute (CPU) demand is preserved \r\n• The system needs to consider that, while running a job, the virtual capacity \r\ncurve (VCC) might drop. Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Why?\r\n\r\nOne would expect zero carbon intensity from solar-\r\npanels or wind farms, but that’s not the case.\r\n⚠\r\n?\r\n\r\nMarginal Power Plant\r\n• Renewable-based power plants cannot adapt to demand. \r\n• When demand is higher than the existing power in the electricity grid, we \r\nneed a power plant that is able to scale up to that demand. \r\n• This is usually done by fossil-based power plants. They are called the \r\nmarginal power plants. \r\n• The problem is that marginal power plants do not scale down to zero. \r\n• There is always a minimum carbon that needs to be emitted, even if there is \r\na lot of renewable energy in the grid.\r\n32\r\n\r\nBy Asim Hussain: https://principles.green/principles/carbon-intensity/\r\nHow could we fix this?\r\nWhat’s the problem here?\r\n\r\nMarginal Carbon Intensity\r\n• Increase or decrease in carbon emissions in the electrical grid, in response \r\nto an infinitesimal increase/decrease in power demand/supply.\r\n\r\nFrom: “Literature Review: On the effectiveness of a Marginal Carbon Intensity Signal “\r\n\r\nWhy is marginal carbon intensity \r\nrelevant for software?\r\n• Tip: consider a task scheduler in a datacenter.', '• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

1. **Alignment with Personal Values**: Many developers are motivated by personal values and a desire to contribute positively to the environment. Working for a green company allows them to align their professional work with their personal beliefs about sustainability and environmental responsibility.

2. **Career Opportunities**: As sustainability becomes a more significant factor in business, green companies often offer innovative projects and cutting-edge technologies that can be attractive to developers looking to advance their careers.

3. **Market Demand**: There is a growing demand for sustainable products and services. Developers working for green companies can be part of creating solutions that meet this demand, which can be both professionally rewarding and financially beneficial.

4. **Corporate Culture**: Green companies often foster a corporate culture that emphasizes social responsibility, ethical practices, and a supportive work environment, which can be appealing to developers.

5. **Economic Sustainability**: Green procurement is becoming essential for economic sustainability, as customers increasingly prefer services and products from environmentally responsible companies. This trend can lead to job security and growth opportunities within green companies.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**: With increasing regulations aimed at reducing carbon footprints, developers working for green companies may find themselves at the forefront of compliance and innovation, which can be intellectually stimulating and rewarding.

These factors make green companies attractive to developers who are not only interested in technology but also in making a positive impact on the world.",Developers work for green companies because green procurement is a main trigger for organizations to worry about sustainability and green software.

It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation! \r\n• Considers Carbon intensity \r\n• Using data from electricityMap.org \r\n• It does not use carbon intensity directly.\u2028\r\nCarbon intensity is converted to a cost (kgCO2 -> $$) \r\n• This way, they can factor in other metrics that can also be converted to money. E.g., the \r\ncost saved by preventing peak load \r\n• Peak workload entails extra cost at the infrastructure level (e.g., control faclities’ \r\ntemperature). \r\n• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Hence, this job should not start in the first place. \r\n• They forecast VCC for the next day\r\n24\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• Aims at reducing the peak load at carbon intensive hours but in total it should allow for the \r\nsome amount of daily computation!', '• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal. Unless there’s a \r\ngood reason. \r\n• E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n• (It happens and that’s ok!)– consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy – falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n• If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.

Start measuring\r\n8\r\n\r\nConnecting Monsoon to a Smartphone\r\n• 5. Automate User Interface interaction \r\n• The last thing you want to do is to manually interact with the smartphone \r\nwhile you measure energy consumption. Tests are less accurate, less \r\nreproducible, and, in this case, the screen cannot not be easily accessed. \r\n• Tools to automate interaction with Android phones: \r\n• To open, install, close apps: adb \r\n• To interact with the app: Appium, Robotium, UIAutomator, espresso, \r\netc. \r\n• Alternative: physalia is a library that automates all adb interactions and \r\nPyMonsoon calls.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIssue 1: USB cable!\r\n• You need the USB cable to automate the interaction with the phone. \r\n• When you connect the USB cable, measurements become\u2028\r\nunreliable. \r\n• Solution: \r\n• Monsoon has a feature to control the USB connection (switch on/off) \r\n• Option 1: Right before starting measurements, the USB connection is stopped. \r\n• Works fine when when all the interaction instructions can be sent in advance and the time for the \r\nexecution is already known. \r\n• Option 2: using USB, set up a wireless ADB connection. Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device. E.g., getting push notifications, \r\nchecking nearby bluetooth devices, etc. \r\n• Moreover, brightness may change according to environment. Different \r\nscreen brightness, different results.', '• By using money cost instead of carbon cost, they have more data available.\r\n26\r\n\r\nVirtual Cluster Capacity (VCC)\r\n• If the forecast of VCC fails it shift flexible workload more than expected.  \r\n• This happens because the amount of workload forecasted was below the \r\nworkload needed, and VCC was “aggressively” low. \r\n• The systems fall back to the real cluster capacity for 1 week until results \r\nstart being realistic again.\r\n27\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n• They will consider spatial flexibility. \r\n• I.e., tasks that can be shifted over time and over space. \r\n• It needs to factor in relocation overheads, though.\r\n28\r\n\r\nCritical questions\r\n• Who defines what is flexible and inflexible? \r\n• How do you estimate the CPU load of a given task?\r\n29\r\n\r\nEnergy Regression Testing\r\n→Energy?\r\nGreener?

Tests are less accurate, less \r\nreproducible, and, in this case, the screen cannot not be easily accessed. \r\n• Tools to automate interaction with Android phones: \r\n• To open, install, close apps: adb \r\n• To interact with the app: Appium, Robotium, UIAutomator, espresso, \r\netc. \r\n• Alternative: physalia is a library that automates all adb interactions and \r\nPyMonsoon calls.\r\n9\r\n\r\nIssue 1: USB cable!\r\n• You need the USB cable to automate the interaction with the phone. \r\n• When you connect the USB cable, measurements become\u2028\r\nunreliable. \r\n• Solution: \r\n• Monsoon has a feature to control the USB connection (switch on/off) \r\n• Option 1: Right before starting measurements, the USB connection is stopped. \r\n• Works fine when when all the interaction instructions can be sent in advance and the time for the \r\nexecution is already known. \r\n• Option 2: using USB, set up a wireless ADB connection. Stop USB connections afterwards. \r\n• How to: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3623727\r\n10\r\n\r\nIssue 2: your app is not exclusive\r\n• Many activities run in a smartphone device. E.g., getting push notifications, \r\nchecking nearby bluetooth devices, etc. \r\n• Moreover, brightness may change according to environment. Different \r\nscreen brightness, different results. \r\n• You need to reduce tasks to the bare minimum: \r\n• Set brightness to a fixed value; turn off notifications, kill all user-owned \r\nprocesses, turn off cellular data, bluetooth, location services, account \r\nsyncs; uninstall all unnecessary apps, etc.\r\n11\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to desktop/cloud software, the sources \r\nof noise are different but the same concerns apply. \r\n \r\nEach case is different – think it through!\r\n⚠\r\n\r\nEnergy Profilers\r\n• Simple setup!

Exploratory Analysis\r\n• Plot the data and inspect outliers or \r\nunexpected biases. \r\n• Violin+box plots are usually handy. (?) \r\n• It’s a nice way of combining the 30 \r\nexperiments, and of showing \r\ndescriptive statistics. (?) \r\n• Shows the shape of the distribution \r\nof the data.\r\n15\r\n\r\n1. Exploratory Analysis (II)\r\n• Data should be Normal. Unless there’s a \r\ngood reason. \r\n• E.g., somewhere amongst the 30 executions, \r\nthere might be 1 or 2 that failed to finish due \r\nto some unexpected error. \r\n• (It happens and that’s ok!)– consequently, \r\nthe execution is shorter and spends less \r\nenergy – falsely appearing as more \r\nenergy efficient. \r\n• If data is not Normal there might be some \r\nissues affecting the measurements that \r\nmight be ruining results. It is important to \r\ninvestigate this.\r\n16\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. Why?\r\n• It might be caused by one of the following reasons: \r\n• There was an error in some of the executions. If not detected and fixed it \r\nmight ruin results. \r\n• Your tests are not fully replicable or are not deterministic. Quite frequent \r\nwhen you have internet requests or random-based algorithms. \r\n• There is an unusual task being run by the system during some experiments. \r\n• The computer entered a different power mode. \r\n• External physical conditions have changed. E.g., someone opened a \r\nwindow.\r\n17\r\n\r\nEnergy data is not normal. How to fix?\r\n• We have 2+1 options: \r\n1. Remove outliers. If there are only a few points that deviate from the normal \r\ndistribution, it is okay to simply remove them. \r\n• Use the z-score outlier removal. (?) \r\n• Remove all data points that deviate from the mean more than 3 standard \r\ndeviations: \r\n \r\n2. Fix the issue and rerun experiments. \r\n3. Conclude that nothing can be done about it and data will never be normal.

The \r\nhighest the accuracy, the better the model.\r\n3\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the amount of computing used for AI \r\ntraining has been doubling every 6 months\r\n• https://epoch.ai/blog/compute-trends\r\n4\r\n\r\n• To create better AI systems we are currently adding \r\n• More data \r\n• More experiments \r\n• Larger models\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Equation of Red AI\r\nCost(R) ∝E·D·H\r\nCost of a single (E)xample\r\nSize of (D)ataset\r\nNumber of (H)yperparameters\r\nBy Schwartz et al.

E.g., \r\nFibonacci sequence. At least 1min; 5min recommended. \r\n•\r\n6\r\n\r\nRepeat 🔁\r\n• The best way to make sure a measurement is valid is by repeating it. \r\n• In a scientific project, the magic number is 30.\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nRest ⏸\r\n• It is common practice to do a pause/sleep between executions/\r\nmeasurements. \r\n• Prevent tail energy consumption from previous measurements. ? \r\n• Prevent collateral tasks of previous measurement from affecting the next \r\nmeasurement. \r\n• There is no golden rule but one minute should be enough. It can be more or \r\nless depending on your hardware or the duration of your energy test.\r\n9\r\n\r\nt\r\nP\r\nTail Energy Consumption\r\n\r\nShuffle 🔀\r\n• It is not a mystery that energy consumption depends on so many factors that \r\nit is impossible to control all of them. \r\n• If you run 30 executions for version A and another batch for version B: \r\n• External conditions that change over time will have a different bias in \r\nthe 2 versions (e.g., room temperature changes). \r\n• If you shuffle, you reduce this risk.\r\n11\r\n\r\nKeep it cool 🌡\r\n• Always make sure there is a stable room temperature. \r\n• Tricky because, some times, experiments may have to run over a few days. \r\n• If you cannot control room temperature: collect temperature data and filter \r\nout measurements where the room temperature is clearly deviating.\r\n12\r\n\r\nAutomate Executions 🤖\r\n• (Already mentioned in the previous classes) \r\n• One cannot run 30 shuffled experiments per version without automation…\r\n13\r\n\r\nData analysis\r\n14\r\n\r\n1.
